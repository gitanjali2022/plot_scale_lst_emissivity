	abstract = {Two critical limitations for using current satellite sensors in real-time crop management are the lack of imagery with optimum spatial and spectral resolutions and an unfavorable revisit time for most crop stress-detection applications. Alternatives based on manned airborne platforms are lacking due to their high operational costs. A fundamental requirement for providing useful remote sensing products in agriculture is the capacity to combine high spatial resolution and quick turnaround times. Remote sensing sensors placed on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) could ﬁll this gap, providing low-cost approaches to meet the critical requirements of spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions. This paper demonstrates the ability to generate quantitative remote sensing products by means of a helicopter-based UAV equipped with inexpensive thermal and narrowband multispectral imaging sensors. During summer of 2007, the platform was ﬂown over agricultural ﬁelds, obtaining thermal imagery in the 7.5–13-μm region (40-cm resolution) and narrowband multispectral imagery in the 400–800-nm spectral region (20-cm resolution). Surface reﬂectance and temperature imagery were obtained, after atmospheric corrections with MODTRAN. Biophysical parameters were estimated using vegetation indices, namely, normalized difference vegetation index, transformed chlorophyll absorption in reﬂectance index/optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index, and photochemical reﬂectance index (PRI), coupled with SAILH and FLIGHT models. As a result, the image products of leaf area index, chlorophyll content (Cab), and water stress detection from PRI index and canopy temperature were produced and successfully validated. This paper demonstrates that results obtained with a low-cost UAV system for agricultural applications yielded comparable estimations, if not better, than those obtained by traditional manned airborne sensors.},

	abstract = {Land surface temperature (LST) and emissivity for large areas can only be derived from surface-leaving radiation measured by satellite sensors. These measurements represent the integrated eVect of the surface and are, thus, for many applications, superior to point measurements on the ground, e.g. in Earth’s radiation budget and climate change detection. Over the years, a substantial amount of research was dedicated to the estimation of LST and emissivity from passive sensor data. This article provides the theoretical basis and gives an overview of the current status of this research. Sensors operating in the visible, infrared and microwave range onboard various meteorological satellites are considered, e.g. Meteosat-MVIRI, NOAA-AVHRR, ERS-ATSR, Terra-MODIS, Terra-ASTER and DMSP-SSM/I. Atmospheric eVects on measured brightness temperatures are described and atmospheric corrections using radiative transfer models (RTM) are explained. The substitution of RTM with neural networks (NN) for faster forward calculations is also discussed. The methods reviewed for LST estimation are the single-channel method, the split-window techniques (SWT), and the multi-angle method, and, for emissivity estimation, the normalized emissivity method (NEM ), the thermal infrared spectral indices (TISI) method, the spectral ratio method, alpha residuals, normalized diVerence vegetation index (NDVI )-based methods, classi cation-based emissivity and the temperature emissivity separation (TES) algorithm.},

	abstract = {In this study, high-resolution thermal imagery acquired with a small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is used to map evapotranspiration (ET) at a grassland site in Luxembourg. The land surface temperature (LST) information from the thermal imagery is the key input to a one-source and two-source energy balance model. While the one-source model treats the surface as a single uniform layer, the two-source model partitions the surface temperature and fluxes into soil and vegetation components. It thus explicitly accounts for the different contributions of both components to surface temperature as well as turbulent flux exchange with the atmosphere. Contrary to the two-source model, the one-source model requires an empirical adjustment parameter in order to account for the effect of the two components. Turbulent heat flux estimates of both modelling approaches are compared to eddy covariance (EC) measurements using the high-resolution input imagery UAVs provide. In this comparison, the effect of different methods for energy balance closure of the EC data on the agreement between modelled and measured fluxes is also analysed. Additionally, the sensitivity of the one-source model to the derivation of the empirical adjustment parameter is tested. Due to the very dry and hot conditions during the experiment, pronounced thermal patterns developed over the grassland site. These patterns result in spatially variable turbulent heat fluxes. The model comparison indicates that both models are able to derive ET estimates that compare well with EC measurements under these conditions. However, the two-source model, with a more complex treatment of the energy and surface temperature partitioning between the soil and vegetation, outperformed the simpler one-source model in estimating sensible and latent heat fluxes. This is consistent with findings from prior studies. For the one-source model, a time-variant expression of the adjustment parameter (to account for the difference between aerodynamic and radiometric temperature) that depends on the surface-to-air temperature gradient yielded the best agreement with EC measurements. This study showed that the applied UAV system equipped with a dual-camera set-up allows for the acquisition of thermal imagery with high spatial and temporal resolution that illustrates the small-scale heterogeneity of thermal surface properties. The UAV-based thermal imagery therefore provides the means for analysing patterns of LST and other surface properties with a high level of detail that cannot be obtained by traditional remote sensing methods.},

	abstract = {In an effort to better evaluate distributed airborne remotely sensed sensible and latent heat flux estimates, two heat flux source area (footprint) models were applied to the imagery, and their pixel weighting/ integrating functionality was investigated through statistical analysis. Soil heat flux and sensible heat flux models were calibrated. The latent heat flux was determined as a residual from the energy balance equation. The resulting raster images were integrated using the 2D footprints and were compared to eddy covariance energy balance flux measurements. The results show latent heat flux estimates (adjusted for closure) with errors of (mean Ϯ std dev) Ϫ9.2 Ϯ 39.4 W mϪ2, sensible heat flux estimate errors of 9.4 Ϯ 28.3 W mϪ2, net radiation error of Ϫ4.8 Ϯ 20.7 W mϪ2, and soil heat flux error of Ϫ0.5 Ϯ 24.5 W mϪ2. This good agreement with measured values indicates that the adopted methodology for estimating the energy balance components, using high-resolution airborne multispectral imagery, is appropriate for modeling latent heat fluxes. The method worked well for the unstable atmospheric conditions of the study. The footprint weighting/ integration models tested indicate that they perform better than simple pixel averages upwind from the flux stations. In particular the flux source area model (footprint) seemed to better integrate the resulting heat flux image pixels. It is suggested that future studies test the methodology for heterogeneous surfaces under stable atmospheric conditions.},

	abstract = {This study highlights the possibilities and constraints of determining instantaneous spatial surface radiation and land heat fluxes from satellite images in a heterogeneous urban area and its agricultural and natural surroundings. Net radiation was determined using ASTER satellite data and MODTRAN radiative transfer calculations. The soil heat flux was estimated with two empirical methods using radiative terms and vegetation indices. The turbulent heat fluxes finally were determined with the LUMPS (Local-Scale Urban Meteorological Parameterization Scheme) and the ARM (Aerodynamic Resistance Method) method. Results were compared to in situ measured ground data. The performance of the atmospheric correction was found to be crucial for the estimation of the radiation balance and thereafter the heat fluxes. The soil heat flux could be modeled satisfactorily by both of the applied approaches. The LUMPS method, for the turbulent fluxes, appeals by its simplicity. However, a correct spatial estimation of associated parameters could not always be achieved. The ARM method showed the better spatial results for the turbulent heat fluxes. In comparison with the in situ measurements however, the LUMPS approach rendered the better results than the ARM method.},

	abstract = {Two resistance network formulations that are used in a two-source model for parameterizing soil and canopy energy exchanges are evaluated for a wide range of soybean and corn crop cover and soil moisture conditions during the Soil Moisture–Atmosphere Coupling Experiment (SMACEX). The parallel resistance formulation does not consider interaction between the soil and canopy fluxes, whereas the series resistance algorithms provide interaction via the computation of a within-air canopy temperature. Land surface temperatures were derived from high-resolution Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM)/Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) scenes and aircraft imagery. These data, along with tower-based meteorological data, provided inputs for the two-source energy balance model. Comparison of the local model output with tower-based flux observations indicated that both the parallel and series resistance formulations produced basically similar estimates with root-mean-square difference (RMSD) values ranging from approximately 20 to 50 W mϪ2 for net radiation and latent heat fluxes, respectively. The largest relative difference in percentage [mean absolute percent difference (MAPD)] was for sensible heat flux, which was Ϸ35\%, followed by a MAPD Ϸ 25\% for soil heat flux, Ϸ10\% for latent heat flux, and a MAPD Ͻ 5\% for net radiation. Although both series and parallel versions gave similar results, the parallel resistance formulation was found to be more sensitive to model parameter specification, particularly in accounting for the effects of vegetation clumping resulting from row crop planting on flux partitioning. A sensitivity and model stability analysis for a key model input variable, that is, fractional vegetation cover, also show that the parallel resistance network is more sensitive to the errors vegetation cover estimates. Furthermore, it is shown that for a much narrower range in vegetation cover fraction, compared to the series resistance network, the parallel resistance scheme is able to achieve a balance in both the radiative temperature and convective heat fluxes between the soil and canopy components. This result appears to be related to the moderating effects of the air temperature in the canopy air space computed in the series resistance scheme, which represents the effective source height for turbulent energy exchange across the soil–canopy–atmosphere system.},

The 37 GHz vertical polarized brightness temperature is used to derive Ts because it is considered the most appropriate microwave frequency for temperature retrieval. This channel balances a reduced sensitivity to soil surface characteristics with a relatively high atmospheric transmissivity. It is shown that with a simple linear relationship, accurate values for Ts can be obtained from this frequency, with a theoretical bias of within 1 K for 70\% of vegetated land areas of the globe. Barren, sparsely vegetated, and open shrublands cannot be accurately described with this single channel approach because variable surface conditions become important. The precision of the retrieved land surface temperature is expected to be better than 2.5 K for forests and 3.5 K for low vegetation. This method can be used to complement existing infrared derived temperature products, especially during clouded conditions. With several microwave radiometers currently in orbit, this method can be used to observe the diurnal temperature cycles with surprising accuracy.},

Here, this issue is explored experimentally and analytically in three adjacent ecosystems (a grass-covered old-field, OF, a planted pine forest, PP, and a hardwood forest, HW) representing a successional chronosequence in the SE. The results showed that changes in albedo alone can warm the surface by 0.9°C for the OF-to-PP conversion, and 0.7°C for the OF-to-HW conversion on annual time scales. However, changes in eco-physiological and aerodynamic attributes alone can cool the surface by 2.9 and 2.1°C, respectively. Both model and measurements consistently suggest a stronger over-all surface cooling for the OF-to-PP conversion, and the reason is attributed to leaf area variations and its impacts on boundary layer conductance.},

	abstract = {Land surface temperature and emissivity (LST\&E) data are essential for a wide variety of surface-atmosphere studies, from calculating the evapotranspiration of the Earth's land surface to retrieving atmospheric water vapor. LST\&E products are generated from thermal infrared data acquired from sensors such as ASTER and MODIS on NASA's EOS platforms. NASA has identified a major need to develop long-term, consistent products valid across multiple missions, with well-defined uncertainty statistics addressing specific Earth science questions. These products are termed Earth System Data Records (ESDRs) and LST\&E have been identified as an important ESDR. Currently a lack of understanding in LST\&E uncertainties limits their usefulness in land surface and climate models. To address this issue, a LST\&E uncertainty simulator has been developed to quantify and model uncertainties for a variety of TIR sensors and LST algorithms. Using the simulator, uncertainties were estimated for the MODIS and ASTER TES algorithm, including water vapor scaling (WVS). These uncertainties were parameterized according to view angle and estimated total column water vapor for application to real data. The standard ASTER TES algorithm had a RMSE of 3.1 K (1.2 K with WVS), while the MODIS TES algorithm had a RMSE of 4.5 K (1.5 K with WVS). Accuracies in retrieved spectral emissivity for both sensors degraded with higher atmospheric water content, however, with WVS the emissivity uncertainties were reduced to {\textless}0.015. Accurately quantifying uncertainties in LST\&E products not only improves their utility and understanding but will also enable the data to be fused into long-term, well characterized ESDRs.},

Merr.) rotation agricultural ecosystem that has been in no-till cultivation for over 14 years. These measurements were used to determine the net ecosystem exchange of carbon (NEE) at the local scale and for the North Central Region of the U.S. (NCR). Results show that at the local scale, the no-till ecosystem is a carbon sink when planted with maize (576 g C mÀ2 per year) and soybean (33 g C mÀ2 per year). On a regional scale, the carbon sink is proportionally lower than that of the local scale. This is attributed to regional consumption of the grain (over 85\% of all NCR grain is consumed elsewhere in the world) combined with the carbon emissions associated with agricultural practices. Since nearly 100\% of both maize and soybean yields are consumed annually, e.g. all carbon stored in grain is consumed somewhere in the world, the long-term carbon-sequestration potential of this system is lower than revealed with the local and regional analysis. Accounting for 100\% grain consumption, maize still acts as a C-sink of 184 g C mÀ2 per year while soybean becomes a C-source of 94 g C mÀ2 per year. As these two crops are grown in rotation, the system when accounting for all emissions to the atmosphere is a net sink of 90 g C mÀ2 per year. Overall, however, the potential exists for long-term carbon sequestration.},

The role of canopy storage terms from canopy water content and photosynthesis is usually neglected in the surface energy balance of crops. Data from a research ﬂux tower in central Illinois were used to evaluate these storage terms and their impact on the closure of the surface energy balance. When considered separately, the storage terms are generally a small fraction ({\textless}5\%) of the net radiation. However, the combination of soil and canopy heat storage and the stored energy in the carbohydrate bonds from photosynthesis are shown to comprise roughly 15\% of the total net radiation for maize and 7\% for soybean during the morning hours from 06:00 to 12:00 h when the canopy is fully developed. When all of the storage terms were considered, the slopes of the 1:1 line between net radiation and the partitioned ﬂuxes (latent, sensible, ground, and storage) increased by 10\% and the scatter about the 1:1 line decreased for both maize and soybean with the r2 increasing by 0.05.},

	abstract = {The primary function of stomata is to minimize plant water loss while maintaining CO2 assimilation. Stomatal water loss incurs an indirect cost to photosynthesis in the form of non-stomatal limitations (NSL) via reduced carboxylation capacity (CAP) and/or mesophyll conductance (MES). Two optimal formulations for stomatal conductance (gs) arise from the assumption of each type of NSL. In reality, both NSL could coexist, but one may prevail for a given leaf ontogenetic stage or plant functional type, depending on leaf morphology. We tested the suitability of two gs formulations (CAP versus MES) on species from six plant functional types (C4 crop, C3 grass, fern, conifer, evergreen, and deciduous angiosperm trees). MES and CAP parameters (the latter proportional to the marginal water cost to carbon gain) decreased with water availability only in deciduous angiosperm trees, while there were no clear differences between leaf ontogenetic stages. Both CAP and MES formulations fit our data in most cases, particularly under low water availability. For ferns, stomata appeared to operate optimally only when subjected to water stress. Overall, the CAP formulation provided a better fit across all species, suggesting that sub-daily stomatal responses minimize NSL by reducing carboxylation capacity predominantly, regardless of leaf morphology and ontogenetic stage.},

During this monsoon period the mean canopy height and the leaf area index were 0.05 m and 0.5, respectively. The study site represented the prevailing conditions of the high Tibetan plateau with an average elevation of 4500 m. The model was initialized using in situ measurements and was driven by half-hourly atmospheric observations. The modeled values for the two months period were compared with micrometeorological field measurements made through the Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) Asian Monsoon Experiment (GAME)-Tibet project. Results show that (1) when underestimating net radiation by 11\%, the model overestimated sensible, latent, and soil heat fluxes by 8, 3, and 13\% respectively; (2) the model generated warmer (colder) ground surface in daytime (nighttime); and (3) soil wetness was estimated reasonably.},

Usually the convolution is performed in wavenumber space. However, numerical experiments presented here indicate that there are brightness temperature (BT) diﬀerences between wavelength and wavenumber spaces in convolving hyperspectral IR sounder spectrum to broadband. The magnitudes of diﬀerences are related to the spectral region and the width of the spectral response functions (SRFs). In addition, the central wavelength and central wavenumber should be determined separately in wavelength and wavenumber spaces, respectively; they cannot be converted to each other directly for broadband BT calculations. There exist BT diﬀerences (BTDs) between interpolating the resolution of SRF to hyperspectral IR sounder spectrum, and vice versa, for convolution. This study provides clarity on convolution, central wavelength/wavenumber determination, and spectral resolution matching between broadband SRFs and hyperspectral IR sounder radiances for intercomparison/calibration.},

	abstract = {High spatial resolution urban climate modeling is essential for understanding urban climatology and predicting the human health impacts under climate change. Satellite thermal remote-sensing data are potential observational sources for urban climate model validation with comparable spatial scales, temporal consistency, broad coverage, and long-term archives. However, sensor view angle, cloud distribution, and cloud-contaminated pixels can confound comparisons between satellite land surface temperature (LST) and modeled surface radiometric temperature. The impacts of sensor view angles on urban LST values are investigated and addressed. Three methods to minimize the confounding factors of clouds are proposed and evaluated using 10years of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data and simulations from the High-Resolution Land Data Assimilation System (HRLDAS) over Greater Houston, Texas, U.S. For the satellite cloud mask (SCM) method, prior to comparison, the cloud mask for each MODIS scene is applied to its concurrent HRLDAS simulation. For the max/min temperature (MMT) method, the 50 warmest days and coolest nights for each data set are selected and compared to avoid cloud impacts. For the high clear-sky fraction (HCF) method, only those MODIS scenes that have a high percentage of clear-sky pixels are compared. The SCM method is recommended for validation of long-term simulations because it provides the largest sample size as well as temporal consistency with the simulations. The MMT method is best for comparison at the extremes. And the HCF method gives the best absolute temperature comparison due to the spatial and temporal consistency between simulations and observations.},

	abstract = {The ASTER scanner on NASA's Terra (EOS-AM1) satellite will collect five channels of TIR data with an NE∆T of ≤0.3K to estimate surface kinetic temperatures and emissivity spectra, especially over land, where emissivities are not known in advance. Temperature/emissivity separation (TES) is difficult because there are five measurements but six unknowns. Various approaches have been used to constrain the extra degree of freedom. ASTER's TES algorithm hybridizes two established algorithms, first estimating the temperature and band emissivities by the Normalized Emissivity Method, and then normalizing the emissivities by their average value. Next, an empirical relationship adapted from the Alpha Residual method is used to predict the minimum emissivity from the spectral contrast (min-max difference or MMD) of the normalized values, permitting recovery of the emissivity spectrum with improved accuracy. TES uses an iterative approach to remove reflected sky irradiance. Input to TES consists of land-leaving radiances (compensated for atmospheric absorption and path radiance) and downwelling sky irradiance. Based on numerical simulation, TES can recover temperatures within about ±1.5 K, and emissivities within about ±0.015. Limitations arise from the empirical relationship between emissivity values and spectral contrast, compensation for reflected sky irradiance, and ASTER's precision, calibration, and atmospheric correction.},

Examples are given showing that the diagram can be used to summarize the relative merits of a collection of different models or to track changes in performance of a model as it is modified.

The radiation and atmospheric parameters were measured during the months of October 2005 to June 2006 at a micrometeorological tower installed at the experimental site in a banana orchard in the semiarid region of Northeast Brazil. The comparative statistics for the performance of the downward longwave radiation calculation models during daytime and nighttime compared to measured data have shown that the parameterizations with more physical foundations have the best results. The locally adjusted equation and Sugita and Brutsaert model developed in 1993 showed errors less than 1.0\% in comparison with measured values. Downward longwave radiation is one of the most expensive and difficult component of the radiation budget to be monitored in micrometeorological studies. Hence, the locally adjusted equation can be used to estimate downward longwave energy, needed as input to some agricultural and hydrological models, in semi-arid regions of the Northeast Brazil, where this component is not monitored.},

Combining the Green's function approach and linear stability analysis, we propose a new physically based numerical procedure to estimate the land surface energy partitioning in this paper. The new method is capable of predicting all surface energy budgets using a single depth soil measurement; the model reliability is evaluated with comparisons to flux tower measurements.

	abstract = {Observations are used to examine how soil moisture influences the surface radiation budget, ground heat flux, and available energy in semiarid environments. Defining this relationship is critical to understand interactions between the land surface and the atmosphere, in particular assessing if a feedback exists between soil moisture and rainfall anomalies. We use two summers of data collected from semiarid grassland and shrubland ecosystems in central New Mexico. The response of surface radiation budget components and other variables to soil moisture variations are quantified via linear regression. Then, the variations are scaled over the observed range of soil moisture (15\% volumetric water content). The soil temperature is lower by {\textgreater}10°C when the surface soil is wet, compared to when the soil is dry. This temperature decrease results in a measured decrease of 85–100 W m−2 in longwave radiation emitted at the surface. The increase in net longwave radiation is equal in magnitude because downward longwave radiation does not vary with soil moisture. The observed changes in net shortwave radiation are relatively minor ({\textless}10 W m−2), as the surface albedo decreases by only 1.5\% when soil is wet. Net radiation increases by an amount roughly equal to the decrease in emitted longwave radiation (∼85–100 W m−2). Changes in ground heat flux are not detectable, given the noise in the data. Therefore the available energy, Qa, is higher by 80 W m−2 when the soil is wet. This change is 22\% of average Qa at the shrubland site and 19\% at the grassland site. The observed soil moisture-induced Qa variations are large compared to other sources of Qa variability, so they should influence boundary layer moist static energy. However, the intervals during which soil moisture is high and therefore Rn and Qa are enhanced are short, on the order of several days. Therefore feedbacks to rainfall may be limited. Compared to other environments, the influence of soil moisture on Rn and Qa is likely greater in semiarid environments because soil moisture-induced fluctuations in evaporative fraction and surface temperature are relatively large.},

	abstract = {Land surface energetic partitioning between latent, sensible, and ground heat fluxes determines climate and influences the terrestrial segment of land-atmosphere coupling. Soil moisture, among other variables, has a direct influence on this partitioning. Dry surfaces characterize a water-limited regime where evapotranspiration and soil moisture are coupled. This coupling is subdued for wet surfaces, or an energy-limited regime. This framework is commonly evaluated using the evaporative fraction–-soil moisture relationship. However, this relationship is explicitly or implicitly prescribed in land surface models. These impositions, in turn, confound model-based evaluations of energetic partitioning-–soil moisture relationships. In this study, we use satellite-based observations of surface temperature diurnal amplitude (directly related to available energy partitioning) and soil moisture, free of model impositions, to estimate characteristics of surface energetic partitioning–-soil moisture relationships during 10–-20-day surface drying periods across Africa. We specifically estimate the spatial patterns of water-limited energy flux sensitivity to soil moisture (m) and the soil moisture threshold separating water and energy-limited regimes (θ*). We also assess how time evolution of other factors (e.g., solar radiation, vapor pressure deficit, surface albedo, and wind speed) can confound the energetic partitioning–-soil moisture relationship. We find higher m in drier regions and interestingly similar spatial θ* distributions across biomes. Vapor pressure deficit and insolation increases during drying tend to increase m. Only vapor pressure deficit increases in the Sahelian grasslands systematically decrease θ*. Ultimately, soil and atmospheric moisture availability together play the largest role in land surface energy partitioning with minimal consistent influences of time evolution of other forcings.},

In the U.S. Southern Great Plains, grassland/pasture and winter wheat are the dominant land covers but have distinct growing periods that may differently influence land-atmosphere coupling during spring and summer. Variables that influence surface flux partitioning can change seasonally, depending on the state of local vegetation. Here we use surface observations from multiple sites in the U.S. Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Southern Great Plains Climate Research Facility and statistical modeling at a paired grassland/agricultural site within this facility to quantify land cover influence on surface energy balance and variables controlling evaporative fraction (latent heat flux normalized by the sum of sensible and latent heat fluxes). We demonstrate that the radiative balance and evaporative fraction are closely related to green leaf area at both winter wheat and grassland/pasture sites and that the early summer harvest of winter wheat abruptly shifts the relationship between evaporative fraction and surface state variables. Prior to harvest, evaporative fraction of winter wheat is strongly influenced by leaf area and soil-atmosphere temperature differences. After harvest, variations in soil moisture have a stronger effect on evaporative fraction. This is in contrast with grassland/pasture sites, where variation in green leaf area has a large influence on evaporative fraction throughout spring and summer, and changes in soil-atmosphere temperature difference and soil moisture are of relatively minor importance.},

We have used measurements from an eddy correlation system to derive the aerodynamic resistance to heat transfer over a bare soil surface as well as over a maize canopy. Diurnal variations of aerodynamic resistance have been analyzed. The results showed that the diurnal variation of aerodynamic resistance during daytime (07:00 h–18:00 h) was signiﬁcant for both the bare soil surface and the maize canopy although the range of variation was limited. Based on the measurements made by the eddy correlation system, a comprehensive evaluation of eight popularly used parameterization schemes of aerodynamic resistance was carried out. The roughness length for heat transfer is a crucial parameter in the estimation of aerodynamic resistance to heat transfer and can neither be taken as a constant nor be neglected. Comparing with the measurements, the parameterizations by Choudhury et al. (1986), Viney (1991), Yang et al. (2001) and the modiﬁed forms of Verma et al. (1976) and Mahrt and Ek (1984) by inclusion of roughness length for heat transfer gave good agreements with the measurements, while the parameterizations by Hatﬁeld et al.

	abstract = {\&lt;p\&gt;\&lt;strong\&gt;Abstract.\&lt;/strong\&gt; Diurnal temperature variations are strongly shaped by the absorption of solar radiation, but evaporation, or the latent heat flux, also plays an important role. Generally, evaporation cools. Its relation to diurnal temperature variations, however, is unclear. This study investigates the diurnal response of surface and air temperatures to evaporation for different vegetation types. We used the warming rate of temperature to absorbed solar radiation in the morning under clear-sky conditions and evaluated how the warming rates change for different evaporative fractions. Results for 51 FLUXNET sites show that the diurnal variation of air temperature carries very weak imprints of evaporation across all vegetation types. However, surface temperature warming rates of short vegetation decrease significantly by {\textasciitilde}\&amp;\#8201;23\&amp;\#8201;\&amp;\#215;\&amp;\#8201;10\&amp;\#8722;3\&amp;\#8201;K/W\&amp;\#8201;m\&lt;sup\&gt;\&amp;\#8722;2\&lt;/sup\&gt; from dry to wet conditions. Contrarily, warming rates of surface and air temperatures are similar at forest sites and carry literally no imprints of evaporation. We explain these contrasting patterns with a surface energy balance model. The model reveals a strong sensitivity of the warming rates to evaporative fraction and aerodynamic conductance. However, for forests the sensitivity to evaporative fraction is strongly reduced by 74\&amp;\#8201;\% due to their large aerodynamic conductance.

	abstract = {\&lt;p\&gt;\&lt;strong\&gt;Abstract.\&lt;/strong\&gt; Diurnal temperature variations are strongly shaped by the absorption of solar radiation, but evaporation, or the latent heat flux, also plays an important role. Generally, evaporation cools. Its relation to diurnal temperature variations, however, is unclear. This study investigates the diurnal response of surface and air temperatures to evaporation for different vegetation types. We used the warming rate of temperature to absorbed solar radiation in the morning under clear-sky conditions and evaluated how the warming rates change for different evaporative fractions. Results for 51 FLUXNET sites show that the diurnal variation of air temperature carries very weak imprints of evaporation across all vegetation types. However, surface temperature warming rates of short vegetation decrease significantly by {\textasciitilde}\&amp;\#8201;23\&amp;\#8201;\&amp;\#215;\&amp;\#8201;10\&amp;\#8722;3\&amp;\#8201;K/W\&amp;\#8201;m\&lt;sup\&gt;\&amp;\#8722;2\&lt;/sup\&gt; from dry to wet conditions. Contrarily, warming rates of surface and air temperatures are similar at forest sites and carry literally no imprints of evaporation. We explain these contrasting patterns with a surface energy balance model. The model reveals a strong sensitivity of the warming rates to evaporative fraction and aerodynamic conductance. However, for forests the sensitivity to evaporative fraction is strongly reduced by 74\&amp;\#8201;\% due to their large aerodynamic conductance. The remaining imprint is reduced further by {\textasciitilde}\&amp;\#8201;50\&amp;\#8201;\% through their enhanced aerodynamic conductance under dry conditions. Our model then compares the individual contributions of solar radiation, evaporation and vegetation types in shaping the diurnal temperature range. These findings have implications for the interpretation of land-atmosphere interactions and the influences of water limitation and vegetation on diurnal temperatures, which is of key importance for ecological functioning. We conclude that diurnal temperature variations may be useful to predict evaporation for short vegetation.

	abstract = {The satellite application facility on land surface analysis (Land SAF) generates, archives, and disseminates land surface temperature (LST) in an operational basis. LST is estimated from the spinning enhanced visible and infrared imager (SEVIRI) onboard Meteosat, making use of a generalized split-windows algorithm. Here SEVIRI LST is compared with retrievals from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS), collocated in space and time, for three 10° × 10° areas (Iberian Peninsula, Central Africa, and the Kalahari), and for six 7-day periods between July 2005 and May 2006. Overall, SEVIRI LSTs are warmer than MODIS values, with maximum discrepancies generally observed for daytime. The mismatches between the two satellite retrievals are then analyzed in terms of (1) satellite viewing angle differences, (2) surface orography, and (3) surface type. Daytime discrepancies are strongly impacted by differential heating rates of elements within a pixel (e.g., vegetation types, bareground), leading to a relatively wide range of MODIS-SEVIRI LST differences, with strong dependency on the MODIS view zenith angle. In contrast, average nighttime discrepancies are generally below 2°C. The intercomparison between MODIS and SEVIRI LST is complemented with in situ observations taken at Evora ground station (southwestern part of the Iberian Peninsula). The differences between ground and satellite-derived values show high variability for daytime for both sensors, with a systematic overestimation of in situ values by SEVIRI LST. In the case of nighttime observations, both sensors tend to underestimate local measurements, with estimated bias over all events under study of −1.7°C and −2.6°C for SEVIRI and MODIS LST, respectively.},

For our approach, a pixel is classiﬁed as one of fourteen “emissivity classes” based on the conventional land cover classiﬁcation and dynamic and seasonal factors, such as snow cover and vegetation index. The emissivity models we present provide the range of values for each emissivity class by combining various spectral component measurements with structural factors. Emissivity statistics are reported for the EOS/MODIS channels 31 and 32, which are the channels that will be used in the LST split-window algorithm.},

	abstract = {The extensive requirement of land surface temperature (LST) for environmental studies and management activities of the Earth’s resources has made the remote sensing of LST an important academic topic during the last two decades. Many studies have been devoted to establishing the methodology for the retrieval of LST from channels 4 and 5 of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data. Various split-window algorithms have been reviewed and compared in the literature to understand their di erences. Di erent algorithms di er in both their forms and the calculation of their coe cients. The most popular form of split-window algorithm is Ts =T4 +A(T4 Õ T5 )+B, where Ts is land surface temperature, T4 and T5 are brightness temperatures of AVHRR channels 4 and 5, A and B are coe cients in relation to atmospheric e ects, viewing angle and ground emissivity. For the actual determination of the coe cients, no matter the complexity of their calculation formulae in various algorithms, only two ways are practically applicable, due to the unavailability of many required data on atmospheric conditions and ground emissivities in situ satellite pass. Ground data measurements can be used to calibrate the brightness temperature obtained by remote sensing into the actual LST through regression analysis on a sample representing the studied region. The other way is standard atmospheric pro® le simulation using computer software such as LOWTRAN 7. Ground emissivity has a considerable e ect on the accuracy of retrieving LST from remote sensing data. Generally, it is rational to assume an emissivity of 0.96 for most ground surfaces. However, the di erence of ground emissivity between channels 4 and 5 also has a signi® cant impact on the accuracy of LST retrieval. By combining the data of AVHRR channels 3, 4 and 5, the di erence can be directly calculated from remote sensing data. Therefore, much more study is required on how to accurately determine the coe cients of split-window algorithms in the application of remote sensing to examine LST change and distribution in the real world.},

	abstract = {Measurements at the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean Experiment (SHEBA) Atmospheric Surface Flux Group (ASFG) tower site from October 1997 to October 1998 are used to describe the annual cycle of the near-surface environment and the surface energy budget (SEB). Comparisons with historical data and climatological estimates suggest that the SHEBA site was 3–8°C warmer in March and April. The unique SHEBA profile measurements showed that the mean near-surface environment is strongly stable during 6 winter months, and near neutral or weakly stable during the other months. However, one-hour data show that neutral stratification does occur 25\% of the time during the winter. The monthly mean flux profiles suggest that turbulent processes cool the near-surface atmosphere during the winter and warm it during the summer, though the sign of the sensible heat flux is negative during both the winter and July. The SHEBA SEB calculation is unique in its nearly exclusive use of observed rather than derived values. The magnitude of the best estimate of the annual net observed surface energy surplus at SHEBA (8.2 W m−2) was consistent with the observed surface ice and snowmelt and was in reasonable agreement with most previous estimates of the net annual SEB over the Arctic pack ice. However, the partitioning of the various components of the SEB differed in the SHEBA data. The SHEBA site had unusually large incoming longwave radiation in the fall and spring, giving an annual mean that was larger by 10.4–19.3 W m−2. The site also had substantially less incoming solar radiation during most months than in previous estimates, producing a difference in the annual mean of 5.0–9.5 W m−2 when compared to these estimates. The observed magnitudes of the sensible (−2.2 W m−2) and latent (1.1 W m−2) heat fluxes at SHEBA were smaller than previous climatological estimates, as were the conductive flux estimates (2.4–5.0 W m−2) at this site. Estimates of the measurement errors suggest that they are not likely to alter the conclusions concerning the SEB terms presented here but will prevent us from conclusively determining the reasons for the net thinning of the ice observed during SHEBA.},

	abstract = {Land surface temperature (LST) plays a key role in governing the land surface energy budget, and measurements or estimates of LST are an integral part of many land surface models and methods to estimate land surface sensible heat (H) and latent heat fluxes. In particular, the LST “anchors” the potential temperature profile in Monin-Obukhov similarity theory, from which H can be derived. Brutsaert has made important contributions to our understanding the nature of surface temperature measurements as well as the practical but theoretically sound use of LST in this framework. His work has coincided with the wide-spread availability of remotely sensed LST measurements. Use of remotely sensed LST estimates inevitably involves complicating factors, such as: varying spatial and temporal scales in measurements, theory, and models; spatial variability of LST and H; the relationship between measurements of LST and the temperature “felt” by the atmosphere; and the need to correct satellite-based radiometric LST measurements for the radiative effects of the atmosphere. This paper reviews the progress made in research in these areas by tracing and commenting on Brutsaert's contributions.},

The parameters which appear in the resistance expression depend essentially on wind velocity and canopy structure but also on the inclination angle of the radiometer.

	abstract = {Land surface temperature (LST) plays a key role in governing the land surface energy budget, and measurements or estimates of LST are an integral part of many land surface models and methods to estimate land surface sensible heat (H) and latent heat ﬂuxes. In particular, the LST ‘‘anchors’’ the potential temperature proﬁle in Monin-Obukhov similarity theory, from which H can be derived. Brutsaert has made important contributions to our understanding the nature of surface temperature measurements as well as the practical but theoretically sound use of LST in this framework. His work has coincided with the widespread availability of remotely sensed LST measurements. Use of remotely sensed LST estimates inevitably involves complicating factors, such as: varying spatial and temporal scales in measurements, theory, and models; spatial variability of LST and H; the relationship between measurements of LST and the temperature ‘‘felt’’ by the atmosphere; and the need to correct satellite-based radiometric LST measurements for the radiative effects of the atmosphere. This paper reviews the progress made in research in these areas by tracing and commenting on Brutsaert’s contributions.},

In this study, Terra Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission Reﬂection Radiometer (ASTER) and Aqua MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 5 LST and emissivity products are evaluated using long-term groundbased longwave radiation observations collected at six Surface Radiation Budget Network (SURFRAD) sites from 2000 to 2007. LSTs at a spatial resolution of 90 m from 197 ASTER images during 2000–2007 are directly compared to ground observations at the six SURFRAD sites. For nighttime data, ASTER LST has an average bias of 0.1 °C and the average bias is 0.3 °C during daytime. Aqua MODIS LST at 1 km resolution during nighttime retrieved from a split-window algorithm is evaluated from 2002 to 2007. MODIS LST has an average bias of − 0.2 °C. LST heterogeneity (deﬁned as the Standard Deviation, STD, of ASTER LSTs in 1 × 1 km2 region, 11 × 11 pixel in total) and instrument calibration error of pyrgeometer are key factors impacting the ASTER and MODIS LST evaluation using ground-based radiation measurements. The heterogeneity of nighttime ASTER LST is 1.2 °C, which accounts for 71\% of the STD of the comparison, while the heterogeneity of the daytime LST is 2.4 °C, which accounts for 60\% of the STD. Collection 5 broadband emissivity is 0.01 larger than that of MODIS Collection 4 products and ASTER emissivity. It is essential to ﬁlter out the abnormal low values of ASTER daily emissivity data in summer time before its application.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Obtaining high resolution records of surface temperature from satellite sensors is important in the Arctic because meteorological stations are scarce and widely scattered in those vast and remote regions. Surface temperature is the primary climatic factor that governs the existence, spatial distribution and thermal regime of permafrost which is a major component of the terrestrial cryosphere. Land Surface (skin) Temperatures (LST) derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor aboard the Terra and Aqua satellite platforms provide spatial estimates of near-surface temperature values. In this study, LST values from MODIS are compared to ground-based near-surface air (Tair) and ground surface temperature (GST) measurements obtained from 2000 to 2008 at herbaceous and shrub tundra sites located in the continuous permafrost zone of Northern Québec, Nunavik, Canada, and of the North Slope of Alaska, USA. LSTs (temperatures at the surface materials-atmosphere interface) are found to be better correlated with Tair (1–3 m above the ground) than with available GST (3–5 cm below the ground surface). As Tair is most often used by the permafrost community, this study focused on this parameter. LSTs are in stronger agreement with Tair during the snow cover season than in the snow free season. Combining Aqua and Terra LST-Day and LST-Nigh acquisitions into a mean daily value provides a large number of LST observations and a better overall agreement with Tair. Comparison between mean daily LSTs and mean daily Tair, for all sites and all seasons pooled together yields a very high correlation (R = 0.97; mean difference (MD) = 1.8 °C; and standard deviation of MD (SD) = 4.0 °C). The large SD can be explained by the influence of surface heterogeneity within the MODIS 1 km2 grid cells, the presence of undetected clouds and the inherent difference between LST and Tair. Retrieved over several years, MODIS LSTs offer a great potential for monitoring surface temperature changes in high-latitude tundra regions and are a promising source of input data for integration into spatially-distributed permafrost models.},

	abstract = {A methodology for estimating ground upwelling, clear-sky and cloud downwelling longwave radiations (L↑, Lsky↓, and Lcld↓) and net shortwave radiation (Sn) at 30-min temporal scales based on long-term ground-based net radiations and meteorological observations is described. Components of surface radiation can be estimated from empirical models, cloud radiation models, and remote sensing observations. The proposed method combines the local calibration of empirical models and the radiative energy balance method to obtain the dual-directional, dual-spectral components of the surface radiation for the offline land surface process modeling and ecosystem study. By extracting information of radiation components from long-term net radiation and concurrent weather data, the utility of tower net radiation observations is maximized. Four test sites with multiyears' radiation records were used to evaluate the method. The results show that when compared with the results of empirical models using default parameters the proposed method is able to produce more accurate estimates of longwave surface components (Lg↑, Lsky↓, Lcld↓) and net shortwave radiation (Sn). Overall, the estimated and observed surface radiation components show high correlations ({\textgreater}0.90), high index of agreement ({\textgreater}0.89), and low errors (root mean square error {\textless}30 W m−2 and bias {\textless}11 W m−2) at all of the test sites. The advantage of this scheme is that the refinement is achieved using the information from the historical net radiation and weather data at each observation site without additional measurements. This method is applicable for many existing observation sites worldwide which have long-term (at least 1 year) continuous net radiation records.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Greenland Ice Sheet surface temperatures are controlled by an exchange of energy at the surface, which includes radiative, turbulent, and ground heat fluxes. Data collected by multiple projects are leveraged to calculate all surface energy budget (SEB) terms at Summit, Greenland, for the full annual cycle from July 2013 to June 2014 and extend to longer periods for the radiative and turbulent SEB terms. Radiative fluxes are measured directly by a suite of broadband radiometers. Turbulent sensible heat flux is estimated via the bulk aerodynamic and eddy correlation methods, and the turbulent latent heat flux is calculated via a two-level approach using measurements at 10 and 2 m. The subsurface heat flux is calculated using a string of thermistors buried in the snow pack. Extensive quality-control data processing produced a data set in which all terms of the SEB are present 75 \% of the full annual cycle, despite the harsh conditions. By including a storage term for a near-surface layer, the SEB is balanced in this data set to within the aggregated uncertainties for the individual terms. November and August case studies illustrate that surface radiative forcing is driven by synoptically forced cloud characteristics, especially by low-level, liquid-bearing clouds. The annual cycle and seasonal diurnal cycles of all SEB components indicate that the non-radiative terms are anticorrelated to changes in the total radiative flux and are hence responding to cloud radiative forcing. Generally, the non-radiative SEB terms and the upwelling longwave radiation component compensate for changes in downwelling radiation, although exact partitioning of energy in the response terms varies with season and near-surface characteristics such as stability and moisture availability. Substantial surface warming from low-level clouds typically leads to a change from a very stable to a weakly stable near-surface regime with no solar radiation or from a weakly stable to neutral/unstable regime with solar radiation. Relationships between forcing terms and responding surface fluxes show that the upwelling longwave radiation produces 65–85 \% (50–60 \%) of the total response in the winter (summer) and the non-radiative terms compensate for the remaining change in the combined downwelling longwave and net shortwave radiation. Because melt conditions are rarely reached at Summit, these relationships are documented for conditions of surface temperature below 0 °C, with and without solar radiation. This is the first time that forcing and response term relationships have been investigated in detail for the Greenland SEB. These results should both advance understanding of process relationships over the Greenland Ice Sheet and be useful for model validation.},

We highlight the impact of the variations of the optical properties of metallic layers on their temperature-dependent emissivity. Fabry-Pe´rot spectral selection involving at most two transparent layers and one thin reﬂective layer leads to well-deﬁned peaks and to the ampliﬁcation of the substrate emission. For a single Fabry-Pe´rot layer on a reﬂective substrate, an optimal thickness that maximizes the emissivity of the structure can be determined at each temperature. A thin lossy layer deposited on the previous structure can enhance interference phenomena, and the analysis of the participation of each layer to the emission shows that the thin layer is the main source of emission. Eventually, we investigate a system with two Fabry-Pe´rot layers and a metallic thin layer, and we show that an optimal architecture can be found. The total hemispherical emissivity can be increased by one order of magnitude compared to the substrate emissivity.},

	abstract = {Two critical limitations for using current satellite sensors in real-time crop management are the lack of imagery with optimum spatial and spectral resolutions and an unfavorable revisit time for most crop stress-detection applications. Alternatives based on manned airborne platforms are lacking due to their high operational costs. A fundamental requirement for providing useful remote sensing products in agriculture is the capacity to combine high spatial resolution and quick turnaround times. Remote sensing sensors placed on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) could ﬁll this gap, providing low-cost approaches to meet the critical requirements of spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions. This paper demonstrates the ability to generate quantitative remote sensing products by means of a helicopter-based UAV equipped with inexpensive thermal and narrowband multispectral imaging sensors. During summer of 2007, the platform was ﬂown over agricultural ﬁelds, obtaining thermal imagery in the 7.5–13-μm region (40-cm resolution) and narrowband multispectral imagery in the 400–800-nm spectral region (20-cm resolution). Surface reﬂectance and temperature imagery were obtained, after atmospheric corrections with MODTRAN. Biophysical parameters were estimated using vegetation indices, namely, normalized difference vegetation index, transformed chlorophyll absorption in reﬂectance index/optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index, and photochemical reﬂectance index (PRI), coupled with SAILH and FLIGHT models. As a result, the image products of leaf area index, chlorophyll content (Cab), and water stress detection from PRI index and canopy temperature were produced and successfully validated. This paper demonstrates that results obtained with a low-cost UAV system for agricultural applications yielded comparable estimations, if not better, than those obtained by traditional manned airborne sensors.},

These measurements represent the integrated eVect of the surface and are, thus, for many applications, superior to point measurements on the ground, e.g. in Earth’s radiation budget and climate change detection. Over the years, a substantial amount of research was dedicated to the estimation of LST and emissivity from passive sensor data. This article provides the theoretical basis and gives an overview of the current status of this research. Sensors operating in the visible, infrared and microwave range onboard various meteorological satellites are considered, e.g. Meteosat-MVIRI, NOAA-AVHRR, ERS-ATSR, Terra-MODIS, Terra-ASTER and DMSP-SSM/I. Atmospheric eVects on measured brightness temperatures are described and atmospheric corrections using radiative transfer models (RTM) are explained. The substitution of RTM with neural networks (NN) for faster forward calculations is also discussed. The methods reviewed for LST estimation are the single-channel method, the split-window techniques (SWT), and the multi-angle method, and, for emissivity estimation, the normalized emissivity method (NEM ), the thermal infrared spectral indices (TISI) method, the spectral ratio method, alpha residuals, normalized diVerence vegetation index (NDVI )-based methods, classi cation-based emissivity and the temperature emissivity separation (TES) algorithm.},

	abstract = {In this study, high-resolution thermal imagery acquired with a small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is used to map evapotranspiration (ET) at a grassland site in Luxembourg. The land surface temperature (LST) information from the thermal imagery is the key input to a one-source and two-source energy balance model. While the one-source model treats the surface as a single uniform layer, the two-source model partitions the surface temperature and fluxes into soil and vegetation components. It thus explicitly accounts for the different contributions of both components to surface temperature as well as turbulent flux exchange with the atmosphere. Contrary to the two-source model, the one-source model requires an empirical adjustment parameter in order to account for the effect of the two components. Turbulent heat flux estimates of both modelling approaches are compared to eddy covariance (EC) measurements using the high-resolution input imagery UAVs provide. In this comparison, the effect of different methods for energy balance closure of the EC data on the agreement between modelled and measured fluxes is also analysed. Additionally, the sensitivity of the one-source model to the derivation of the empirical adjustment parameter is tested. Due to the very dry and hot conditions during the experiment, pronounced thermal patterns developed over the grassland site. These patterns result in spatially variable turbulent heat fluxes. The model comparison indicates that both models are able to derive ET estimates that compare well with EC measurements under these conditions. However, the two-source model, with a more complex treatment of the energy and surface temperature partitioning between the soil and vegetation, outperformed the simpler one-source model in estimating sensible and latent heat fluxes. This is consistent with findings from prior studies. For the one-source model, a time-variant expression of the adjustment parameter (to account for the difference between aerodynamic and radiometric temperature) that depends on the surface-to-air temperature gradient yielded the best agreement with EC measurements. This study showed that the applied UAV system equipped with a dual-camera set-up allows for the acquisition of thermal imagery with high spatial and temporal resolution that illustrates the small-scale heterogeneity of thermal surface properties. The UAV-based thermal imagery therefore provides the means for analysing patterns of LST and other surface properties with a high level of detail that cannot be obtained by traditional remote sensing methods.},

	abstract = {In an effort to better evaluate distributed airborne remotely sensed sensible and latent heat flux estimates, two heat flux source area (footprint) models were applied to the imagery, and their pixel weighting/ integrating functionality was investigated through statistical analysis. Soil heat flux and sensible heat flux models were calibrated. The latent heat flux was determined as a residual from the energy balance equation. The resulting raster images were integrated using the 2D footprints and were compared to eddy covariance energy balance flux measurements. The results show latent heat flux estimates (adjusted for closure) with errors of (mean Ϯ std dev) Ϫ9.2 Ϯ 39.4 W mϪ2, sensible heat flux estimate errors of 9.4 Ϯ 28.3 W mϪ2, net radiation error of Ϫ4.8 Ϯ 20.7 W mϪ2, and soil heat flux error of Ϫ0.5 Ϯ 24.5 W mϪ2. This good agreement with measured values indicates that the adopted methodology for estimating the energy balance components, using high-resolution airborne multispectral imagery, is appropriate for modeling latent heat fluxes. The method worked well for the unstable atmospheric conditions of the study. The footprint weighting/ integration models tested indicate that they perform better than simple pixel averages upwind from the flux stations. In particular the flux source area model (footprint) seemed to better integrate the resulting heat flux image pixels. It is suggested that future studies test the methodology for heterogeneous surfaces under stable atmospheric conditions.},

	abstract = {This study highlights the possibilities and constraints of determining instantaneous spatial surface radiation and land heat fluxes from satellite images in a heterogeneous urban area and its agricultural and natural surroundings. Net radiation was determined using ASTER satellite data and MODTRAN radiative transfer calculations. The soil heat flux was estimated with two empirical methods using radiative terms and vegetation indices. The turbulent heat fluxes finally were determined with the LUMPS (Local-Scale Urban Meteorological Parameterization Scheme) and the ARM (Aerodynamic Resistance Method) method. Results were compared to in situ measured ground data. The performance of the atmospheric correction was found to be crucial for the estimation of the radiation balance and thereafter the heat fluxes. The soil heat flux could be modeled satisfactorily by both of the applied approaches. The LUMPS method, for the turbulent fluxes, appeals by its simplicity. However, a correct spatial estimation of associated parameters could not always be achieved. The ARM method showed the better spatial results for the turbulent heat fluxes. In comparison with the in situ measurements however, the LUMPS approach rendered the better results than the ARM method.},

	abstract = {Two resistance network formulations that are used in a two-source model for parameterizing soil and canopy energy exchanges are evaluated for a wide range of soybean and corn crop cover and soil moisture conditions during the Soil Moisture–Atmosphere Coupling Experiment (SMACEX). The parallel resistance formulation does not consider interaction between the soil and canopy fluxes, whereas the series resistance algorithms provide interaction via the computation of a within-air canopy temperature. Land surface temperatures were derived from high-resolution Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM)/Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) scenes and aircraft imagery. These data, along with tower-based meteorological data, provided inputs for the two-source energy balance model. Comparison of the local model output with tower-based flux observations indicated that both the parallel and series resistance formulations produced basically similar estimates with root-mean-square difference (RMSD) values ranging from approximately 20 to 50 W mϪ2 for net radiation and latent heat fluxes, respectively. The largest relative difference in percentage [mean absolute percent difference (MAPD)] was for sensible heat flux, which was Ϸ35\%, followed by a MAPD Ϸ 25\% for soil heat flux, Ϸ10\% for latent heat flux, and a MAPD Ͻ 5\% for net radiation. Although both series and parallel versions gave similar results, the parallel resistance formulation was found to be more sensitive to model parameter specification, particularly in accounting for the effects of vegetation clumping resulting from row crop planting on flux partitioning. A sensitivity and model stability analysis for a key model input variable, that is, fractional vegetation cover, also show that the parallel resistance network is more sensitive to the errors vegetation cover estimates. Furthermore, it is shown that for a much narrower range in vegetation cover fraction, compared to the series resistance network, the parallel resistance scheme is able to achieve a balance in both the radiative temperature and convective heat fluxes between the soil and canopy components. This result appears to be related to the moderating effects of the air temperature in the canopy air space computed in the series resistance scheme, which represents the effective source height for turbulent energy exchange across the soil–canopy–atmosphere system.},

The 37 GHz vertical polarized brightness temperature is used to derive Ts because it is considered the most appropriate microwave frequency for temperature retrieval. This channel balances a reduced sensitivity to soil surface characteristics with a relatively high atmospheric transmissivity. It is shown that with a simple linear relationship, accurate values for Ts can be obtained from this frequency, with a theoretical bias of within 1 K for 70\% of vegetated land areas of the globe. Barren, sparsely vegetated, and open shrublands cannot be accurately described with this single channel approach because variable surface conditions become important. The precision of the retrieved land surface temperature is expected to be better than 2.5 K for forests and 3.5 K for low vegetation. This method can be used to complement existing infrared derived temperature products, especially during clouded conditions. With several microwave radiometers currently in orbit, this method can be used to observe the diurnal temperature cycles with surprising accuracy.},

Here, this issue is explored experimentally and analytically in three adjacent ecosystems (a grass-covered old-field, OF, a planted pine forest, PP, and a hardwood forest, HW) representing a successional chronosequence in the SE. The results showed that changes in albedo alone can warm the surface by 0.9°C for the OF-to-PP conversion, and 0.7°C for the OF-to-HW conversion on annual time scales. However, changes in eco-physiological and aerodynamic attributes alone can cool the surface by 2.9 and 2.1°C, respectively. Both model and measurements consistently suggest a stronger over-all surface cooling for the OF-to-PP conversion, and the reason is attributed to leaf area variations and its impacts on boundary layer conductance.},

	abstract = {Land surface temperature and emissivity (LST\&E) data are essential for a wide variety of surface-atmosphere studies, from calculating the evapotranspiration of the Earth's land surface to retrieving atmospheric water vapor. LST\&E products are generated from thermal infrared data acquired from sensors such as ASTER and MODIS on NASA's EOS platforms. NASA has identified a major need to develop long-term, consistent products valid across multiple missions, with well-defined uncertainty statistics addressing specific Earth science questions. These products are termed Earth System Data Records (ESDRs) and LST\&E have been identified as an important ESDR. Currently a lack of understanding in LST\&E uncertainties limits their usefulness in land surface and climate models. To address this issue, a LST\&E uncertainty simulator has been developed to quantify and model uncertainties for a variety of TIR sensors and LST algorithms. Using the simulator, uncertainties were estimated for the MODIS and ASTER TES algorithm, including water vapor scaling (WVS). These uncertainties were parameterized according to view angle and estimated total column water vapor for application to real data. The standard ASTER TES algorithm had a RMSE of 3.1 K (1.2 K with WVS), while the MODIS TES algorithm had a RMSE of 4.5 K (1.5 K with WVS). Accuracies in retrieved spectral emissivity for both sensors degraded with higher atmospheric water content, however, with WVS the emissivity uncertainties were reduced to {\textbackslash}textless0.015. Accurately quantifying uncertainties in LST\&E products not only improves their utility and understanding but will also enable the data to be fused into long-term, well characterized ESDRs.},

These measurements were used to determine the net ecosystem exchange of carbon (NEE) at the local scale and for the North Central Region of the U.S. (NCR). Results show that at the local scale, the no-till ecosystem is a carbon sink when planted with maize (576 g C mÀ2 per year) and soybean (33 g C mÀ2 per year). On a regional scale, the carbon sink is proportionally lower than that of the local scale. This is attributed to regional consumption of the grain (over 85\% of all NCR grain is consumed elsewhere in the world) combined with the carbon emissions associated with agricultural practices. Since nearly 100\% of both maize and soybean yields are consumed annually, e.g. all carbon stored in grain is consumed somewhere in the world, the long-term carbon-sequestration potential of this system is lower than revealed with the local and regional analysis. Accounting for 100\% grain consumption, maize still acts as a C-sink of 184 g C mÀ2 per year while soybean becomes a C-source of 94 g C mÀ2 per year. As these two crops are grown in rotation, the system when accounting for all emissions to the atmosphere is a net sink of 90 g C mÀ2 per year. Overall, however, the potential exists for long-term carbon sequestration.},

Stomatal water loss incurs an indirect cost to photosynthesis in the form of non-stomatal limitations (NSL) via reduced carboxylation capacity (CAP) and/or mesophyll conductance (MES). Two optimal formulations for stomatal conductance (gs) arise from the assumption of each type of NSL. In reality, both NSL could coexist, but one may prevail for a given leaf ontogenetic stage or plant functional type, depending on leaf morphology. We tested the suitability of two gs formulations (CAP versus MES) on species from six plant functional types (C4 crop, C3 grass, fern, conifer, evergreen, and deciduous angiosperm trees). MES and CAP parameters (the latter proportional to the marginal water cost to carbon gain) decreased with water availability only in deciduous angiosperm trees, while there were no clear differences between leaf ontogenetic stages. Both CAP and MES formulations fit our data in most cases, particularly under low water availability. For ferns, stomata appeared to operate optimally only when subjected to water stress. Overall, the CAP formulation provided a better fit across all species, suggesting that sub-daily stomatal responses minimize NSL by reducing carboxylation capacity predominantly, regardless of leaf morphology and ontogenetic stage.},

	abstract = {This paper examines the performance of a stand-alone version of the Simple Biosphere Model 2 (SiB2) to investigate the accuracy of the modeled surface energy components, surface effective radiative temperature, and soil wetness in a Tibetan short grass prairie from 15 July to 14 September 1998. During this monsoon period the mean canopy height and the leaf area index were 0.05 m and 0.5, respectively. The study site represented the prevailing conditions of the high Tibetan plateau with an average elevation of 4500 m. The model was initialized using in situ measurements and was driven by half-hourly atmospheric observations. The modeled values for the two months period were compared with micrometeorological field measurements made through the Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) Asian Monsoon Experiment (GAME)-Tibet project. Results show that (1) when underestimating net radiation by 11\%, the model overestimated sensible, latent, and soil heat fluxes by 8, 3, and 13\% respectively; (2) the model generated warmer (colder) ground surface in daytime (nighttime); and (3) soil wetness was estimated reasonably.},

	abstract = {Converting the hyperspectral infrared (IR) sounder radiance spectrum to broadband is a common approach for intercomparison/calibration. Usually the convolution is performed in wavenumber space. However, numerical experiments presented here indicate that there are brightness temperature (BT) diﬀerences between wavelength and wavenumber spaces in convolving hyperspectral IR sounder spectrum to broadband. The magnitudes of diﬀerences are related to the spectral region and the width of the spectral response functions (SRFs). In addition, the central wavelength and central wavenumber should be determined separately in wavelength and wavenumber spaces, respectively; they cannot be converted to each other directly for broadband BT calculations. There exist BT diﬀerences (BTDs) between interpolating the resolution of SRF to hyperspectral IR sounder spectrum, and vice versa, for convolution. This study provides clarity on convolution, central wavelength/wavenumber determination, and spectral resolution matching between broadband SRFs and hyperspectral IR sounder radiances for intercomparison/calibration.},

	abstract = {High spatial resolution urban climate modeling is essential for understanding urban climatology and predicting the human health impacts under climate change. Satellite thermal remote-sensing data are potential observational sources for urban climate model validation with comparable spatial scales, temporal consistency, broad coverage, and long-term archives. However, sensor view angle, cloud distribution, and cloud-contaminated pixels can confound comparisons between satellite land surface temperature (LST) and modeled surface radiometric temperature. The impacts of sensor view angles on urban LST values are investigated and addressed. Three methods to minimize the confounding factors of clouds are proposed and evaluated using 10years of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data and simulations from the High-Resolution Land Data Assimilation System (HRLDAS) over Greater Houston, Texas, U.S. For the satellite cloud mask (SCM) method, prior to comparison, the cloud mask for each MODIS scene is applied to its concurrent HRLDAS simulation. For the max/min temperature (MMT) method, the 50 warmest days and coolest nights for each data set are selected and compared to avoid cloud impacts. For the high clear-sky fraction (HCF) method, only those MODIS scenes that have a high percentage of clear-sky pixels are compared. The SCM method is recommended for validation of long-term simulations because it provides the largest sample size as well as temporal consistency with the simulations. The MMT method is best for comparison at the extremes. And the HCF method gives the best absolute temperature comparison due to the spatial and temporal consistency between simulations and observations.},

	abstract = {The ASTER scanner on NASA's Terra (EOS-AM1) satellite will collect five channels of TIR data with an NE∆T of ≤0.3K to estimate surface kinetic temperatures and emissivity spectra, especially over land, where emissivities are not known in advance. Temperature/emissivity separation (TES) is difficult because there are five measurements but six unknowns. Various approaches have been used to constrain the extra degree of freedom. ASTER's TES algorithm hybridizes two established algorithms, first estimating the temperature and band emissivities by the Normalized Emissivity Method, and then normalizing the emissivities by their average value. Next, an empirical relationship adapted from the Alpha Residual method is used to predict the minimum emissivity from the spectral contrast (min-max difference or MMD) of the normalized values, permitting recovery of the emissivity spectrum with improved accuracy. TES uses an iterative approach to remove reflected sky irradiance. Input to TES consists of land-leaving radiances (compensated for atmospheric absorption and path radiance) and downwelling sky irradiance. Based on numerical simulation, TES can recover temperatures within about ±1.5 K, and emissivities within about ±0.015. Limitations arise from the empirical relationship between emissivity values and spectral contrast, compensation for reflected sky irradiance, and ASTER's precision, calibration, and atmospheric correction.},

Methods are suggested for indicating on these diagrams the statistical significance of apparent differences and the degree to which observational uncertainty and unforced internal variability limit the expected agreement between model-simulated and observed behaviors.

The comparative statistics for the performance of the downward longwave radiation calculation models during daytime and nighttime compared to measured data have shown that the parameterizations with more physical foundations have the best results. The locally adjusted equation and Sugita and Brutsaert model developed in 1993 showed errors less than 1.0\% in comparison with measured values. Downward longwave radiation is one of the most expensive and difficult component of the radiation budget to be monitored in micrometeorological studies. Hence, the locally adjusted equation can be used to estimate downward longwave energy, needed as input to some agricultural and hydrological models, in semi-arid regions of the Northeast Brazil, where this component is not monitored.},

Defining this relationship is critical to understand interactions between the land surface and the atmosphere, in particular assessing if a feedback exists between soil moisture and rainfall anomalies. We use two summers of data collected from semiarid grassland and shrubland ecosystems in central New Mexico. The response of surface radiation budget components and other variables to soil moisture variations are quantified via linear regression. Then, the variations are scaled over the observed range of soil moisture (15\% volumetric water content). The soil temperature is lower by {\textbackslash}textgreater10°C when the surface soil is wet, compared to when the soil is dry. This temperature decrease results in a measured decrease of 85–100 W m−2 in longwave radiation emitted at the surface. The increase in net longwave radiation is equal in magnitude because downward longwave radiation does not vary with soil moisture. The observed changes in net shortwave radiation are relatively minor ({\textbackslash}textless10 W m−2), as the surface albedo decreases by only 1.5\% when soil is wet. Net radiation increases by an amount roughly equal to the decrease in emitted longwave radiation (∼85–100 W m−2). Changes in ground heat flux are not detectable, given the noise in the data. Therefore the available energy, Qa, is higher by 80 W m−2 when the soil is wet. This change is 22\% of average Qa at the shrubland site and 19\% at the grassland site. The observed soil moisture-induced Qa variations are large compared to other sources of Qa variability, so they should influence boundary layer moist static energy. However, the intervals during which soil moisture is high and therefore Rn and Qa are enhanced are short, on the order of several days. Therefore feedbacks to rainfall may be limited. Compared to other environments, the influence of soil moisture on Rn and Qa is likely greater in semiarid environments because soil moisture-induced fluctuations in evaporative fraction and surface temperature are relatively large.},

	abstract = {Land surface energetic partitioning between latent, sensible, and ground heat fluxes determines climate and influences the terrestrial segment of land-atmosphere coupling. Soil moisture, among other variables, has a direct influence on this partitioning. Dry surfaces characterize a water-limited regime where evapotranspiration and soil moisture are coupled. This coupling is subdued for wet surfaces, or an energy-limited regime. This framework is commonly evaluated using the evaporative fraction–-soil moisture relationship. However, this relationship is explicitly or implicitly prescribed in land surface models. These impositions, in turn, confound model-based evaluations of energetic partitioning-–soil moisture relationships. In this study, we use satellite-based observations of surface temperature diurnal amplitude (directly related to available energy partitioning) and soil moisture, free of model impositions, to estimate characteristics of surface energetic partitioning–-soil moisture relationships during 10–-20-day surface drying periods across Africa. We specifically estimate the spatial patterns of water-limited energy flux sensitivity to soil moisture (m) and the soil moisture threshold separating water and energy-limited regimes (θ*). We also assess how time evolution of other factors (e.g., solar radiation, vapor pressure deficit, surface albedo, and wind speed) can confound the energetic partitioning–-soil moisture relationship. We find higher m in drier regions and interestingly similar spatial θ* distributions across biomes. Vapor pressure deficit and insolation increases during drying tend to increase m. Only vapor pressure deficit increases in the Sahelian grasslands systematically decrease θ*. Ultimately, soil and atmospheric moisture availability together play the largest role in land surface energy partitioning with minimal consistent influences of time evolution of other forcings.},

In the U.S. Southern Great Plains, grassland/pasture and winter wheat are the dominant land covers but have distinct growing periods that may differently influence land-atmosphere coupling during spring and summer. Variables that influence surface flux partitioning can change seasonally, depending on the state of local vegetation. Here we use surface observations from multiple sites in the U.S. Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Southern Great Plains Climate Research Facility and statistical modeling at a paired grassland/agricultural site within this facility to quantify land cover influence on surface energy balance and variables controlling evaporative fraction (latent heat flux normalized by the sum of sensible and latent heat fluxes). We demonstrate that the radiative balance and evaporative fraction are closely related to green leaf area at both winter wheat and grassland/pasture sites and that the early summer harvest of winter wheat abruptly shifts the relationship between evaporative fraction and surface state variables. Prior to harvest, evaporative fraction of winter wheat is strongly influenced by leaf area and soil-atmosphere temperature differences. After harvest, variations in soil moisture have a stronger effect on evaporative fraction. This is in contrast with grassland/pasture sites, where variation in green leaf area has a large influence on evaporative fraction throughout spring and summer, and changes in soil-atmosphere temperature difference and soil moisture are of relatively minor importance.},

	abstract = {Parameterizations of aerodynamic resistance to heat and water transfer have a signiﬁcant impact on the accuracy of models of land – atmosphere interactions and of estimated surface ﬂuxes using spectro-radiometric data collected from aircrafts and satellites. We have used measurements from an eddy correlation system to derive the aerodynamic resistance to heat transfer over a bare soil surface as well as over a maize canopy. Diurnal variations of aerodynamic resistance have been analyzed. The results showed that the diurnal variation of aerodynamic resistance during daytime (07:00 h–18:00 h) was signiﬁcant for both the bare soil surface and the maize canopy although the range of variation was limited. Based on the measurements made by the eddy correlation system, a comprehensive evaluation of eight popularly used parameterization schemes of aerodynamic resistance was carried out. The roughness length for heat transfer is a crucial parameter in the estimation of aerodynamic resistance to heat transfer and can neither be taken as a constant nor be neglected. Comparing with the measurements, the parameterizations by Choudhury et al. (1986), Viney (1991), Yang et al. (2001) and the modiﬁed forms of Verma et al. (1976) and Mahrt and Ek (1984) by inclusion of roughness length for heat transfer gave good agreements with the measurements, while the parameterizations by Hatﬁeld et al. (1983) and Xie (1988) showed larger errors even though the roughness length for heat transfer has been taken into account.},

	abstract = {The satellite application facility on land surface analysis (Land SAF) generates, archives, and disseminates land surface temperature (LST) in an operational basis. LST is estimated from the spinning enhanced visible and infrared imager (SEVIRI) onboard Meteosat, making use of a generalized split-windows algorithm. Here SEVIRI LST is compared with retrievals from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS), collocated in space and time, for three 10° × 10° areas (Iberian Peninsula, Central Africa, and the Kalahari), and for six 7-day periods between July 2005 and May 2006. Overall, SEVIRI LSTs are warmer than MODIS values, with maximum discrepancies generally observed for daytime. The mismatches between the two satellite retrievals are then analyzed in terms of (1) satellite viewing angle differences, (2) surface orography, and (3) surface type. Daytime discrepancies are strongly impacted by differential heating rates of elements within a pixel (e.g., vegetation types, bareground), leading to a relatively wide range of MODIS-SEVIRI LST differences, with strong dependency on the MODIS view zenith angle. In contrast, average nighttime discrepancies are generally below 2°C. The intercomparison between MODIS and SEVIRI LST is complemented with in situ observations taken at Evora ground station (southwestern part of the Iberian Peninsula). The differences between ground and satellite-derived values show high variability for daytime for both sensors, with a systematic overestimation of in situ values by SEVIRI LST. In the case of nighttime observations, both sensors tend to underestimate local measurements, with estimated bias over all events under study of −1.7°C and −2.6°C for SEVIRI and MODIS LST, respectively.},

	abstract = {The extensive requirement of land surface temperature (LST) for environmental studies and management activities of the Earth’s resources has made the remote sensing of LST an important academic topic during the last two decades. Many studies have been devoted to establishing the methodology for the retrieval of LST from channels 4 and 5 of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data. Various split-window algorithms have been reviewed and compared in the literature to understand their di erences. Di erent algorithms di er in both their forms and the calculation of their coe cients. The most popular form of split-window algorithm is Ts =T4 +A(T4 Õ T5 )+B, where Ts is land surface temperature, T4 and T5 are brightness temperatures of AVHRR channels 4 and 5, A and B are coe cients in relation to atmospheric e ects, viewing angle and ground emissivity. For the actual determination of the coe cients, no matter the complexity of their calculation formulae in various algorithms, only two ways are practically applicable, due to the unavailability of many required data on atmospheric conditions and ground emissivities in situ satellite pass. Ground data measurements can be used to calibrate the brightness temperature obtained by remote sensing into the actual LST through regression analysis on a sample representing the studied region. The other way is standard atmospheric pro® le simulation using computer software such as LOWTRAN 7. Ground emissivity has a considerable e ect on the accuracy of retrieving LST from remote sensing data. Generally, it is rational to assume an emissivity of 0.96 for most ground surfaces. However, the di erence of ground emissivity between channels 4 and 5 also has a signi® cant impact on the accuracy of LST retrieval. By combining the data of AVHRR channels 3, 4 and 5, the di erence can be directly calculated from remote sensing data. Therefore, much more study is required on how to accurately determine the coe cients of split-window algorithms in the application of remote sensing to examine LST change and distribution in the real world.},

Comparisons with historical data and climatological estimates suggest that the SHEBA site was 3–8°C warmer in March and April. The unique SHEBA profile measurements showed that the mean near-surface environment is strongly stable during 6 winter months, and near neutral or weakly stable during the other months. However, one-hour data show that neutral stratification does occur 25\% of the time during the winter. The monthly mean flux profiles suggest that turbulent processes cool the near-surface atmosphere during the winter and warm it during the summer, though the sign of the sensible heat flux is negative during both the winter and July. The SHEBA SEB calculation is unique in its nearly exclusive use of observed rather than derived values. The magnitude of the best estimate of the annual net observed surface energy surplus at SHEBA (8.2 W m−2) was consistent with the observed surface ice and snowmelt and was in reasonable agreement with most previous estimates of the net annual SEB over the Arctic pack ice. However, the partitioning of the various components of the SEB differed in the SHEBA data. The SHEBA site had unusually large incoming longwave radiation in the fall and spring, giving an annual mean that was larger by 10.4–19.3 W m−2. The site also had substantially less incoming solar radiation during most months than in previous estimates, producing a difference in the annual mean of 5.0–9.5 W m−2 when compared to these estimates. The observed magnitudes of the sensible (−2.2 W m−2) and latent (1.1 W m−2) heat fluxes at SHEBA were smaller than previous climatological estimates, as were the conductive flux estimates (2.4–5.0 W m−2) at this site. Estimates of the measurement errors suggest that they are not likely to alter the conclusions concerning the SEB terms presented here but will prevent us from conclusively determining the reasons for the net thinning of the ice observed during SHEBA.},

	abstract = {Land surface temperature (LST) plays a key role in governing the land surface energy budget, and measurements or estimates of LST are an integral part of many land surface models and methods to estimate land surface sensible heat (H) and latent heat fluxes. In particular, the LST “anchors” the potential temperature profile in Monin-Obukhov similarity theory, from which H can be derived. Brutsaert has made important contributions to our understanding the nature of surface temperature measurements as well as the practical but theoretically sound use of LST in this framework. His work has coincided with the wide-spread availability of remotely sensed LST measurements. Use of remotely sensed LST estimates inevitably involves complicating factors, such as: varying spatial and temporal scales in measurements, theory, and models; spatial variability of LST and H; the relationship between measurements of LST and the temperature “felt” by the atmosphere; and the need to correct satellite-based radiometric LST measurements for the radiative effects of the atmosphere. This paper reviews the progress made in research in these areas by tracing and commenting on Brutsaert's contributions.},

In this study, the performance of various z0h and z0m schemes developed for the Noah land surface model is assessed for a high-altitude site (3430 m) on the northeastern part of the Tibetan Plateau. Based on the in situ surface heat ﬂuxes and proﬁle measurements of wind and temperature, monthly variations of z0m and diurnal variations of z0h are derived through application of the Monin–Obukhov similarity theory. These derived values together with the measured heat ﬂuxes are utilized to assess the performance of those z0m and z0h schemes for different seasons. The analyses show that the z0m dynamics are related to vegetation dynamics and soil water freeze–thaw state, which are reproduced satisfactorily with current z0m schemes. Further, it is demonstrated that the heat ﬂux simulations are very sensitive to the diurnal variations of z0h. The newly developed z0h schemes all capture, at least over the sparse vegetated surfaces during the winter season, the observed diurnal variability much better than the original one. It should, however, be noted that for the dense vegetated surfaces during the spring and monsoon seasons, not all newly developed schemes perform consistently better than the original one. With the most promising schemes, the Noah simulated sensible heat ﬂux, latent heat ﬂux, Tsfc, and soil temperature improved for the monsoon season by about 29\%, 79\%, 75\%, and 81\%, respectively. In addition, the impact of Tsfc calculation and energy balance closure associated with measurement uncertainties on the above ﬁndings are discussed, and the selection of the appropriate z0h scheme for applications is addressed.},

Defining radiative temperature as the mean temperature of the surfaces viewed by the radiometer (leaves and soil surface) and assuming that an Ohm’s law type formula can be.used to express sensible heat flux as a function of the difference between air temperature and radiative temperature, the aerodynamic resistance which divides this temperature difference has been analytically defined. The parameters which appear in the resistance expression depend essentially on wind velocity and canopy structure but also on the inclination angle of the radiometer. Finally an experimental verification is presented with data obtained over a potato crop.},

	abstract = {Land surface temperature (LST) plays a key role in governing the land surface energy budget, and measurements or estimates of LST are an integral part of many land surface models and methods to estimate land surface sensible heat (H) and latent heat ﬂuxes. In particular, the LST ‘‘anchors’’ the potential temperature proﬁle in Monin-Obukhov similarity theory, from which H can be derived. Brutsaert has made important contributions to our understanding the nature of surface temperature measurements as well as the practical but theoretically sound use of LST in this framework. His work has coincided with the widespread availability of remotely sensed LST measurements. Use of remotely sensed LST estimates inevitably involves complicating factors, such as: varying spatial and temporal scales in measurements, theory, and models; spatial variability of LST and H; the relationship between measurements of LST and the temperature ‘‘felt’’ by the atmosphere; and the need to correct satellite-based radiometric LST measurements for the radiative effects of the atmosphere. This paper reviews the progress made in research in these areas by tracing and commenting on Brutsaert’s contributions.},

In this study, Terra Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission Reﬂection Radiometer (ASTER) and Aqua MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 5 LST and emissivity products are evaluated using long-term groundbased longwave radiation observations collected at six Surface Radiation Budget Network (SURFRAD) sites from 2000 to 2007. LSTs at a spatial resolution of 90 m from 197 ASTER images during 2000–2007 are directly compared to ground observations at the six SURFRAD sites. For nighttime data, ASTER LST has an average bias of 0.1 °C and the average bias is 0.3 °C during daytime. Aqua MODIS LST at 1 km resolution during nighttime retrieved from a split-window algorithm is evaluated from 2002 to 2007. MODIS LST has an average bias of − 0.2 °C. LST heterogeneity (deﬁned as the Standard Deviation, STD, of ASTER LSTs in 1 × 1 km2 region, 11 × 11 pixel in total) and instrument calibration error of pyrgeometer are key factors impacting the ASTER and MODIS LST evaluation using ground-based radiation measurements. The heterogeneity of nighttime ASTER LST is 1.2 °C, which accounts for 71\% of the STD of the comparison, while the heterogeneity of the daytime LST is 2.4 °C, which accounts for 60\% of the STD. Collection 5 broadband emissivity is 0.01 larger than that of MODIS Collection 4 products and ASTER emissivity.

	abstract = {Abstract. Obtaining high resolution records of surface temperature from satellite sensors is important in the Arctic because meteorological stations are scarce and widely scattered in those vast and remote regions. Surface temperature is the primary climatic factor that governs the existence, spatial distribution and thermal regime of permafrost which is a major component of the terrestrial cryosphere. Land Surface (skin) Temperatures (LST) derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor aboard the Terra and Aqua satellite platforms provide spatial estimates of near-surface temperature values. In this study, LST values from MODIS are compared to ground-based near-surface air (Tair) and ground surface temperature (GST) measurements obtained from 2000 to 2008 at herbaceous and shrub tundra sites located in the continuous permafrost zone of Northern Québec, Nunavik, Canada, and of the North Slope of Alaska, USA. LSTs (temperatures at the surface materials-atmosphere interface) are found to be better correlated with Tair (1–3 m above the ground) than with available GST (3–5 cm below the ground surface). As Tair is most often used by the permafrost community, this study focused on this parameter. LSTs are in stronger agreement with Tair during the snow cover season than in the snow free season. Combining Aqua and Terra LST-Day and LST-Nigh acquisitions into a mean daily value provides a large number of LST observations and a better overall agreement with Tair. Comparison between mean daily LSTs and mean daily Tair, for all sites and all seasons pooled together yields a very high correlation (R = 0.97; mean difference (MD) = 1.8 °C; and standard deviation of MD (SD) = 4.0 °C). The large SD can be explained by the influence of surface heterogeneity within the MODIS 1 km2 grid cells, the presence of undetected clouds and the inherent difference between LST and Tair. Retrieved over several years, MODIS LSTs offer a great potential for monitoring surface temperature changes in high-latitude tundra regions and are a promising source of input data for integration into spatially-distributed permafrost models.},

	abstract = {A methodology for estimating ground upwelling, clear-sky and cloud downwelling longwave radiations (L↑, Lsky↓, and Lcld↓) and net shortwave radiation (Sn) at 30-min temporal scales based on long-term ground-based net radiations and meteorological observations is described. Components of surface radiation can be estimated from empirical models, cloud radiation models, and remote sensing observations. The proposed method combines the local calibration of empirical models and the radiative energy balance method to obtain the dual-directional, dual-spectral components of the surface radiation for the offline land surface process modeling and ecosystem study. By extracting information of radiation components from long-term net radiation and concurrent weather data, the utility of tower net radiation observations is maximized. Four test sites with multiyears' radiation records were used to evaluate the method. The results show that when compared with the results of empirical models using default parameters the proposed method is able to produce more accurate estimates of longwave surface components (Lg↑, Lsky↓, Lcld↓) and net shortwave radiation (Sn). Overall, the estimated and observed surface radiation components show high correlations ({\textbackslash}textgreater0.90), high index of agreement ({\textbackslash}textgreater0.89), and low errors (root mean square error {\textbackslash}textless30 W m−2 and bias {\textbackslash}textless11 W m−2) at all of the test sites. The advantage of this scheme is that the refinement is achieved using the information from the historical net radiation and weather data at each observation site without additional measurements. This method is applicable for many existing observation sites worldwide which have long-term (at least 1 year) continuous net radiation records.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Greenland Ice Sheet surface temperatures are controlled by an exchange of energy at the surface, which includes radiative, turbulent, and ground heat fluxes. Data collected by multiple projects are leveraged to calculate all surface energy budget (SEB) terms at Summit, Greenland, for the full annual cycle from July 2013 to June 2014 and extend to longer periods for the radiative and turbulent SEB terms. Radiative fluxes are measured directly by a suite of broadband radiometers. Turbulent sensible heat flux is estimated via the bulk aerodynamic and eddy correlation methods, and the turbulent latent heat flux is calculated via a two-level approach using measurements at 10 and 2 m. The subsurface heat flux is calculated using a string of thermistors buried in the snow pack. Extensive quality-control data processing produced a data set in which all terms of the SEB are present 75 \% of the full annual cycle, despite the harsh conditions. By including a storage term for a near-surface layer, the SEB is balanced in this data set to within the aggregated uncertainties for the individual terms. November and August case studies illustrate that surface radiative forcing is driven by synoptically forced cloud characteristics, especially by low-level, liquid-bearing clouds. The annual cycle and seasonal diurnal cycles of all SEB components indicate that the non-radiative terms are anticorrelated to changes in the total radiative flux and are hence responding to cloud radiative forcing. Generally, the non-radiative SEB terms and the upwelling longwave radiation component compensate for changes in downwelling radiation, although exact partitioning of energy in the response terms varies with season and near-surface characteristics such as stability and moisture availability. Substantial surface warming from low-level clouds typically leads to a change from a very stable to a weakly stable near-surface regime with no solar radiation or from a weakly stable to neutral/unstable regime with solar radiation. Relationships between forcing terms and responding surface fluxes show that the upwelling longwave radiation produces 65–85 \% (50–60 \%) of the total response in the winter (summer) and the non-radiative terms compensate for the remaining change in the combined downwelling longwave and net shortwave radiation. Because melt conditions are rarely reached at Summit, these relationships are documented for conditions of surface temperature below 0 °C, with and without solar radiation. This is the first time that forcing and response term relationships have been investigated in detail for the Greenland SEB. These results should both advance understanding of process relationships over the Greenland Ice Sheet and be useful for model validation.},

Clear-sky measurements from satellite preferentially sample drier, more stable conditions relative to the monthly-mean state. The resulting observational bias is evident when OLRc is stratified by vertical motion; differences to climate model OLRc of 15 Wm−2 occur over warm regions of strong ascent. Using data from the ECMWF 40-year reanalysis, an estimate of cloud longwave radiative effect is made which is directly comparable with standard climate model diagnostics. The impact of this methodology on the cancellation of cloud longwave and shortwave radiative forcing in the tropics is estimated.},

	abstract = {We investigate the thermal radiative emission of few-layer structures deposited on a metallic substrate and its dependence on temperature with the Fluctuational Electrodynamics approach. We highlight the impact of the variations of the optical properties of metallic layers on their temperature-dependent emissivity. Fabry-Pe´rot spectral selection involving at most two transparent layers and one thin reﬂective layer leads to well-deﬁned peaks and to the ampliﬁcation of the substrate emission. For a single Fabry-Pe´rot layer on a reﬂective substrate, an optimal thickness that maximizes the emissivity of the structure can be determined at each temperature. A thin lossy layer deposited on the previous structure can enhance interference phenomena, and the analysis of the participation of each layer to the emission shows that the thin layer is the main source of emission. Eventually, we investigate a system with two Fabry-Pe´rot layers and a metallic thin layer, and we show that an optimal architecture can be found. The total hemispherical emissivity can be increased by one order of magnitude compared to the substrate emissivity.},

This is the so-called constant-emissivity assumption. Accurate broadband emissivity data are needed as model inputs to better simulate the land surface climate. It is demonstrated in this paper that the assumption of the constant emissivity induces errors in modeling the surface energy budget, especially over large arid and semiarid areas where ␧ is far smaller than unity. One feasible solution to this problem is to apply the satellite-based broadband emissivity into land surface models.},
