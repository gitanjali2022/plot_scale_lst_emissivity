\begin{abstract}

Land surface temperature (LST) is a preeminent state variable that controls the energy and water exchange between the Earth’s surface and the atmosphere. At the landscape scale, LST is derived from thermal infrared radiance measured using space-borne radiometers. At the plot-scale, the flux tower recorded longwave radiation components are inverted  to retrieve LST. Since the down-welling longwave component was not measured routinely until  more recently, the conventional practice uses Stephan Boltzman for the plot-scale LST retrieval (only the up-welling longwave component). However, we hypothesize that ignoring down-welling longwave radiation for plot-scale LST and emissivity estimations may lead to substantial discrepancies compared to the approach including down-welling longwave radiation. The current work addresses these two necessary question using observations at ten eddy covariance towers on different land cover types. We found that the LST values obtained using up-welling and down-welling longwave components (long equation) are 0.5 to 1.5K lower than the equation using only the up-welling longwave components (short equation). Plot-scale emissivity was estimated using observed sensible heat flux and estimated surface to air temperature difference. The emissivity obtained using the long equation was generally lower than if the short equation was used for all land cover types. We also quantified the uncertainty in plot-scale LST and emissivity due to uncertainty in measured fluxes. We found that despite additional input data for the long equation, the uncertainty in plot-scale LST was not greater than if the short equation was used. Landscape-scale day-time LST obtained from satellite data (MODIS TERRA) were strongly correlated with our plot-scale estimates, but on average, higher by several degrees, regardless of the estimation method. For most sites, the correspondence between MODIS LST and plot-scale LST estimates increased significantly if plot-scale emissivity was used instead of the landscape scale emissivity obtained from satellite measurements. The results of this work have significant implications on the combined use of aerodynamic and radiometric measurements (plot-scale emissivity estimation) to understand the interactions and feedbacks between LST and surface-atmosphere exchange processes.

\section*{Introduction}
%\subsubsection*{LST and net radiation (General statements about the field of research to provide the readers with a setting for the problem to be reported)}
%SJS: While reading, I realised that each of the SEB components can be negative or positive, so I re-wrote to be more general.

The effects of global change are reflected in land surface temperature (LST) anomalues and its interannual variability \cite{rowell2005scenario}. It controls the magnitude and variability of the surface energy balance (SEB) components and simultaneously gets modulated by the SEB partitioning\cite{mallick2015reintroducing,timmermans2007intercomparison}. LST contains imprints of surface moisture and is immensely sensitive to evaporative cooling, which makes it a preeminent variable for studying evaporation and surface-atmosphere exchange \cite{mallick2018critical,trebs2021role,kustas2009advances}. It directly affects the amount of emitted longwave radiation and influences the saturation vapor pressure at the surface that drives latent heat flux. Thus, the ecohydrological functioning and carbon-water coupling are largely controlled by the surface temperature of the soil-vegetation system \cite{still2021imaging}.
 The availability of an extensive network of eddy covariance measurements (FLUXNET) allows us to understand the interactions and feedbacks between the surface-atmosphere exchange processes such as evaporation, transpiration, and its control by the atmosphere and vegetation at the diurnal time scale. However, the unavailability of direct LST measurements at the same scale hinders a detailed understanding of the interactions and feedbacks between LST and surface-atmosphere exchange processes, which is of utmost importance to the climate modeling community (reference). Inversion of the longwave observations in FLUXNET data to obtain LST has been found to strongly depend on the emissivity of the underlying surface\cite{mallick2018bridging}, which is not available as routine measurement. Therefore, estimating in-situ LST is not straightforward due to the involvement of two unknowns (LST and emissivity) inside one measurement variable (up-welling longwave radiation). To circumvent this challenge, this study conducts simultaneous retrievals of LST and emissivity by exploiting the longwave radiation components in conjunction with associated SEB flux measurements.

The SEB components can be sub-divided into radiative components (often lumped in net radiation, $R_{net}$) and thermodynamic components, including sensible, latent and ground heat flux ($H$, $LE$, $G$ respectively):
\begin{equation}\label{eq:eq_seb}
R_{net} = H + LE + G 
\end{equation}
 %LST importance
As the surface to air temperature difference drives the exchange of sensible heat between surface and atmosphere, all components of Eq. (\ref{eq:eq_seb}) depend on the LST. Net radiation ($R_{net}$) can be sub-divided into down-welling and up-welling components. Only a fraction of solar top-of-the-atmosphere radiation reaches the Earth's surface, as some is reflected back to space by clouds, some is absorbed by the atmosphere and emitted later as longwave radiation. The emitted longwave radiation as a function of surface temperature ($T_s$, K) and surface emissivity ($\epsilon$) is given by Stefan-Boltzmann (SB) equation:
\begin{equation}\label{eq_Rlem}
R_{lem}= \epsilon \sigma T_{s}^{4}
\end{equation}
where $\sigma$ ($Wm^{-2}K^{-4}$) is the SB constant, $\epsilon$ is the surface emissivity ranging between 0 and 1, $\sigma$ ($Wm^{-2}K^{-4}$) is the Stefan-Boltzman constant and $T_{s}$ ($K$) is the LST. %SJS: What do you mean by ensemble? Is this different to the previous definition of the same parameters? If the same, I would remove the above lines.%GT: yes, I wrote this to remind the reader:it is effective emissivity means representative of the combination of surfaces radiaometers field of view 
Emissivity is defined as efficiency of a surface to emit thermal energy relative to a perfect black body. It  depends on soil type, vegetation cover, soil moisture, soil chemistry, roughness, spectral wavelength, temperature and view angle\cite{norman1995terminology} 
Putting the radiative components together, we can sub-divide $R_{net}$ into:
\begin{equation}\label{eq_Rn1}
R_{net} = R_{sdwn} + R_{ldwn} - R_{sref} - R_{lref} - R_{lem}
\end{equation}
Reflected shortwave in Eq. ({\ref{eq_Rn1}}) is expressed as $R_{sref} = \alpha R_{sdown}$, where $\alpha$ is the surface albedo. Similarly, reflected longwave is a function of down-welling longwave and surface emissivity ($\epsilon$) and expressed as:
\begin{equation}\label{eq_Rlref}
R_{lref} = (1 - \epsilon) R_{ldwn} 
\end{equation}
LST or radiometric temperature is the “ensemble directional radiometric surface temperature” \cite{norman1995terminology}, and can be estimated from the infrared radiance emanating from a given surface\cite{kustas2007utility}. The emitted and down-welling longwave radiance are measured at given angle within its instantaneous field of view (fov) by a downward facing sensor relatively close to the surface (a few meters for an eddy covariance tower). The radiation received by a pyrgeometer or infrared sensor is a combination of the radiation emitted and reflected by the surfaces in its fov. 
%This radiant energy can be attenuated, absorbed, and re-emitted by the atmosphere between the surface and the sensor before reaching the sensor \cite{krishnan2020intercomparison}
\begin{equation}\label{eq_Rlup}
R_{lup} = R_{lem} + R_{lref}
\end{equation}
Substitution of Eqs. (\ref{eq_Rlref} and \ref{eq_Rlem}) into Eq. (\ref{eq_Rlup}) yields $R_{lup}$ as a function of emissivity, surface temperature and down-welling longwave radiation:
\begin{equation}\label{eq_leq}
R_{lup}= \epsilon \sigma T_{s}^{4} + (1- \epsilon)R_{ldwn}
\end{equation}
Eq. (\ref{eq_leq}) is solved for LST as a function of measured longwave and known surface emissivity:
\begin{equation}\label{eq_Tleq}
T_{s} = \sqrt[4]{\frac{R_{ldwn}}{\sigma} - \frac{R_{ldwn}}{\epsilon \sigma} + \frac{R_{lup}}{\epsilon \sigma}}
\end{equation}
. %SJS: really temperature? But then we would have temperature on both sidds of eq_Tleq.%GT:yes, following plancks law, total energy radiated increases with temperature while the peak of the emission spectrum shifts to shorter wavelengths. 

In the last two decades, plot-scale radiometric data collected at eddy covariance sites (ECS) have gained popularity for in-situ LST retrieval due to its wide availability and high temporal resolution \cite{stoy2013data,cullen2007energy}. In addition to this, the LST estimates at plot-scale have a relatively homogeneous footprint in comparison to the satellite obtained LST (MODIS pixels). ECS measurement are primarily used to assess the impacts and feedbacks of climate change on key ecosystem fluxes\cite{baldocchi2001fluxnet}. In order to invert LST as shown in Eq. \eqref{eq_Tleq}, $\epsilon$ values are required. However, radiometers do not measure spectral bands separately to deduce emissivity directly.
%which can be obtained from MODIS,classification table \cite{humes1994variability} or can be calculated for at plot-scale using flux tower measurement \cite{maes2019potential, holmes_cloud_2016, holmes_land_2009}.%SJS: What do you mean by ensemble? Average?
%GT: equivalent or effective emissivity of various surfaces%\subsubsection*
By definition, LST is a thermodynamic temperature that can be felt or measured by an accurate thermometer at the land surface-atmosphere point-of-contact and is independent of wavelength \cite{guillevic2017land}. The instantaneous value of LST is the result of interplay between the net radiation at the surface, $G$, $H$ and $LE$ \cite{wang_global_2013-2}. Thus, LST can also be used for the estimation of $H$ \cite{sun1995relationship} and $LE$ \cite{jacob2001comprehensive} between the surface and the atmosphere. LST provides the lower-boundary condition in SEB models for diagnostic estimates of LE  and is highly relevant for drought monitoring \cite{trebs2021role,mallick2016canopy,mallick2015reintroducing}. For plot-scale emissivity retrieval we focus on $H$, which is defined as the heat transfer driven by a surface to air temperature difference. It can be expressed mathematically in analogy to Ohm's law as:
\begin{equation}\label{eq_H1}
H= \rho C_{p}(T_{s} - T_{a})/r_{a}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq_H}
H= m(T_{s} - T_{a})
\end{equation}
where, $T_{a}$ (K) is the temperature of the air measured at a reference height above the surface, $C_{p}$ $(J kg^{-1} K^{-1})$ is the specific heat capacity of air, $\rho$ $(kgm^{-3})$ is the air-density, $r_{a}$ $(s m^{-1})$ is the total resistance to heat transport from surface to the atmosphere, $m$ $(ms^{-1})$ is a proportionality constant obtained by lumping $(\rho C_{p}/r_{a})$ and can be broadly referred as heat transfer coefficient. $m$ depends on surface characteristics and micro-meteorology \cite{lhomme_radiative_1988}. It is evident from Eq. (\ref{eq_H}) that for $T_{s} - T_{a} = 0$, $H$ will be zero. This boundary condition and the linear relationship  between $H$ and $\Delta T $ is used to estimate $\epsilon$ at the plot-scale from observed $H$, $T_a$ and estimated $T_{s}$ using measured longwave radiation\cite{holmes_land_2009,holmes_cloud_2016-1}. Another approach for plot-scale $\epsilon$ estimation filters the data where H is close to zero, substitutes $T_{s}$ in Eq. (\ref{eq_leq}) by $T_{a} and $ and solves for $\epsilon$\cite{maes2019potential}. %heterogenous nature of vegetated land surface 
%SJS: You should explain a bit more how H, T_a and longwave are used to get an estimate of epsilon. Just in general here, and in more detail in the Methods, where it is not explained at all.
%GT: I have explained %\subsection*{explaining H= K(T_{s} - T_{a})+c}

However, due to surface heterogeneity sparse canopies are prone to footprint mismatch between the aerodynamic (flux tower) footprint and radiometric (hemispherical) footprint \cite{chu2021representativeness,marcolla2018geometry,morillas2013using} which can result into a different boundary condition i.e. at $\Delta T =0$, $H \not= 0$ as shown in Eq. (\ref{eq_H2}). Aerodynamic footprint represents the area contributing to measured sensible heat and air temperature, while the hemispherical footprint is the area within radiometric fov contributing to the measured longwave radiation (used for $T_{s}$ estimation).
\begin{equation}\label{eq_H2}
H= m(T_{s} - T_{a}) \pm  c(H)
\end{equation}
$H$ is representative of the sensible heat flux from the eddy covariance tower footprint, $T_{s}$ is representative of all the radiating surfaces in the sensor’s view, c is interpreted as the $H$ from aerodynamic footprint which is not seen by the radiometer. 
%For example if the mismatch in footprint is a hotter area relative to the shared foot print of the measuring devices  i.e. dry soil patch then $H(\Delta T)$ relationship can be represented by adding a negative intercept to the $H (\Delta T)$ relationship. Similarly if the footprint mismatch is a relatively colder area i.e leaves in shade the regression can have a positive intercept.

%For instance if the radiometer fov has more tree crowns and less soil in comparison to the flux tower footprint the observed longwave will have a bias. In this kind of scenario we would expect a non zero H for 0 $\Delta T$. In order to capture such a bias in plot-scale $\epsilon$ estimation we allowed $H(\Delta T)$ linear regression to have an intercept (c) as shown in Eq. \ref{eq_H2}
%Water-limited ecosystems are more prone to mismatch of tower flux footprint and hemispherical radiometric footprint due to their heterogeneous vegetation composition as compared to the mesic ecosystems (Marcolla and Cescatti, 2018; Morillas et al., 2013)

%\subsection*{Lst estimation using remote sensing}
%Since the 1990s, improvements in infrared thermometrics have resulted in various advancements for the estimation of LST and emissivity using remote sensing \cite{wang_estimation_2005-1}. Remotely sensed thermal data is capable of fully characterizing the daily cycle of LST at the regional scale. The thermal radiance from the land surface is obtained using space-borne instruments consisting of radiometers. The radiative energy  emitted at a specific wavelength is related to its temperature using Planck's function \cite{wang_estimation_2005-1}. Since LST and emissivity are closely coupled\cite{hulley_quantifying_2012-1,jin2006improved,wang_evaluation_2009} the use of Planck's function for natural surfaces (grey bodies) makes the system under-determined as emissivity is unknown. Thus, radiative transfer models are used to solve the under-determined system of equations iteratively to obtain emissivity and LST for a given range of wavelengths (9 - 12$\mu$m). MODIS measures spectral emissivity through four channels (28, 29, 30, 31) at wavelengths ranging between 8-12 $\mu$m \cite{jin_improved_2006-1}. The final LST is obtained by the cumulative sum of radiative energy obtained at different wavelengths using Eq. (\ref{eq_leq}) with derived emissivity for crossponding wavelength\cite{jimenez2006emissitivity}.
%SJS: I find the above difficult to understand. We should get help from Ivonne and Kanishka to describe this better, or even remove the whole paragraph as it is not too relevant for your study, which deals with plot-scale estimates.
%GT: it deals with plot scale but I m comparing plot-scale LST with remotely sensed data as a refrence so it is better i give reader a background of how lst and emissivity is estimated in remote sensing

%\subsection*{Lst estimation using flux tower}
%In last two decades, plot-scale radiometric data collected at eddy covariance sites (ECS) have gained popularity for in-situ LST retrieval due to its high spatial and temporal resolution. In addition to this the land cover specificity is also an important factor as the LST estimates are of relatively homogeneous footprint in comparison to MODIS pixels. These measurements are primarily use to assess the impacts and feedbacks of climate change on key ecosystem fluxes\cite{baldocchi2001fluxnet}.
%The measurements are publicly available through different networks, e.g., SURFRAD (https://esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/grad/surfrad/), FLUXNET (https://fluxnet.org/) or TERN (http://www.ozflux.org.au/monitoringsites/). Most ECS record high quality surface longwave radiation data using tower-mounted radiometers, infrared thermometers or pyrgeometers. The range of measurement wavelengths for infrared thermometers ranges between $6.5 and 14 µm$
%SJS: Below, I try to motivate the use of $H$ for plot-scale LST retrieval, to improve the flow.
%The disadvantage is that the surface emissivity of the tower footprint cannot be estimated using radiative transfer models as radiometers do not measure spectral bands separately to deduce emissivity directly.
Plot-scale $\epsilon$ estimation using observed $H$, $T_{a}$, $R_{lup}$, $R_{ldw}$ as described above, may be prone to substantial uncertainty. It is unclear how uncertainties in observed fluxes propagate into the uncertainty of estimated LST and $\epsilon$. By design, infrared thermal (IRT) sensors only measure up-welling infrared radiance and therefore cannot explicitly account for the amount of reflected down-welling infrared radiation in the signal. For a long time, down-welling longwave $R_{ldw}$ was not routinely observed at ECS \cite{wang_evaluation_2009-1} and was also considered to be the most poorly quantified component of the radiation budget \cite{trenberth2012tracking}. Therefore, the second term in Eq. (\ref{eq_leq}) is commonly omitted, arguing that $\epsilon\approx 1$, and therefore Eq. (\ref{eq_leq}) is simplified to Eq. (\ref{eq_Rlem}) \cite{crago_use_2014-3}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq_seq}
R_{lup} \approx \epsilon \sigma T_{s}^{4}
\end{equation} 
Eq. (\ref{eq_seq}) can be solved for $T_s$ to yield what we will term the "short equation" (seq) for $T_s$:
\begin{equation}\label{eq_Tseq}
T_{s} \approx \sqrt[4]{\frac{R_{lup}}{\epsilon \sigma}}
\end{equation} 
Note that the above derivation is actually flawed, as the second term of Eq. (\ref{eq_leq}) was omitted arguing that $\epsilon\approx 1$, and yet $\epsilon$ was retained in the first part of the equation. Nevertheless, even with the availability of down-welling longwave measurements \cite{stephens1995review}, the use of Eq. (\ref{eq_seq}) is still a common practice\cite{crago_use_2014-2,mallick2018bridging}. This gives rise to the question if the short equation (Eq. \ref{eq_Tseq}) is adequate to estimate LST from ground-based measurements. In the remainder of this paper, we will refer to LST obtained using the long equation (Eq. \ref{eq_Tleq}) as $T_{leq}$ and to LST obtained using the short equation (Eq. \ref{eq_Tseq}) as $T_{seq}$.

%\subsection*{Purpose and objectives of this study}
%SJS: Does SciRep allow sub-sections in the intro? If so, I would introduce a few above, and definitely uncomment this subsection heading.
%GT:no in sci repo no subsection for introduction is allowed

In the present study, we evaluate and analyse the differences in plot-scale LST and emissivity estimated using the long (Eq. \ref{eq_Tleq}) and short (Eq. \ref{eq_Tseq}) equations. 
The following research questions are addressed:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Do we get an adequate estimate of plot-scale LST by neglecting the reflected down-welling longwave radiation?
	\item Does the estimation of plot-scale $\epsilon$ based on observed sensible heat flux ($H$) have an advantage over satellite-derived $\epsilon$ for LST estimation?
    %\item Does accepting an intercept in $H (\Delta$ T) lead to realistic estimate of plot-scale $\epsilon$?
    \item How much uncertainty is introduced in plot-scale LST and $\epsilon$ due to uncertainty in measured EC fluxes?
    
\end{enumerate}    
To answer these questions, we analysed data for ten eddy covariance sites in different biomes and climates (see Table \ref{table:studysites}).
Plot-scale broadband monthly emissivity was derived using observed $H$ and estimated $\Delta T$ as proposed by Holmes et al. \cite{holmes_land_2009}.  Plot-scale LST was estimated using plot-scale or landscape scale emissivity with (Eq. \ref{eq_Tleq}) and (Eq. \ref{eq_Tseq}). Plot-scale LST was compared with MODIS LST (TERRA satellite-sensed) for the times of satellite overpass. Uncertainty in $\epsilon$ and LST due to uncertainty in observed fluxes were calculated using SOBOL based uncertainty analysis (SAlib) \cite{rosolem2012fully}. %SJS: Need to provide references for SOBOL and SAlib.%GT added ref.

%SJS: In the main text of the results section, you should describe the important features of the results, i.e. the take-away messages that you will come back to during the discussion.

%Details needed to understand each figure should be provided in the respective figure caption. I will try to re-write the below to give an example.
%SJS: I re-ordered the results, as I think it flows better to start with the comparison with Holmes and then present the other sites and comparison with MODIS LST.
\subsection{Plot-scale $\epsilon$ using long and short equation}

Following the method proposed by Holmes et al. \cite{holmes_land_2009, holmes_cloud_2016}, plot-scale monthly $\epsilon$ was estimated at the study site by fitting $\epsilon$ to minimise the root mean square error (RMSE) of the regression between $H$ and $T_s - T_a$ (\textbf{SI Fig. \ref{fig:rmse_eps}}). In Fig. \ref{fig:HDT}a, c, and d, we reproduced the original data of Figs. 2a, 3C, and 3Q from Holmes et al. (2009) \cite{holmes_land_2009} to validate our interpretation of their approach using the short equation (Eq. \ref{eq_Tseq}). We noted only marginal differences between the two results based on the short equation which are likely due to fitting algorithms. The replication of the $H (\Delta T)$ plot using the long equation (Eq. \ref{eq_Tleq}) in their analysis is given in Fig. \ref{fig:HDT}b and the $\epsilon$ resulting is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:HDT}c, d by blue stars. The retrieved LST values were slightly higher using Eq. (\ref{eq_Tleq}) (compare a and b in Fig. \ref{fig:HDT}). The use of long equation (Eq. \ref{eq_Tleq}) resulted in substantially lower values of $\epsilon$ (10\%) as compared to the values estimated by Holmes et al.\cite{holmes_land_2009} for the common study sites (Brookings, Fig. \ref{fig:HDT}c and Yatir, Fig. \ref{fig:HDT}d). Another approach for plot-scale $\epsilon$ estimation by Maes et al. (2019) \cite{maes2019potential} using (Eq. \ref{eq_Tleq})  also resulted into lower $\epsilon$ for Brookings as shown by $leq_{M}$ in Fig. \ref{fig:HDT}c and median of $\epsilon$ value is higher than 1 for Yatir (red star in  Fig. \ref{fig:HDT}d). Note that the long equation also yielded $H(\Delta T)$ relationship for many more months at Yatir Forest (blue star) than the short equation (black dots) as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:HDT}d, as it resulted in achieving a strong correlation between $H$ and $\Delta T$ (section \ref{sec:Methods} for details). The pattern of lower $\epsilon$ and higher LST using the long equation compared to the short equation was confirmed for all the ten sites used in the present study (Table \textbf{SI 2}).

\subsection{Landscape scale vs plot-scale estimates of $\epsilon$ and LST}
At each site, LST was estimated using both the short equation ($T_{seq}$, Eq. \ref{eq_Tseq}) and the long equation ($T_{leq}$, Eq. \ref{eq_Tleq}). In the first step, tower-based longwave radiation and landscape scale broadband $\epsilon$ from MODIS spectral $\epsilon$ ($\epsilon_{MODIS}$, Eq. \ref{eq_emodis}) was used. The yearly daytime surface to air temperature difference for each study site is estimated and shown in Fig. \ref{fig:long_short_eq_epsilon_MODIS}. At all sites, Eq. (\ref{eq_Tseq}) resulted in higher day-time plot-scale $T_{s}$ estimates as compared to Eq. (\ref{eq_Tleq}), when using $\epsilon_{MODIS}$, with the medians of surface to air temperature differences ($\Delta T$) differing by 0.8 to 1.5K (Fig. \ref{fig:long_short_eq_epsilon_MODIS}). The difference in $\Delta T$ using the two equations is highest at the water limited sites e.g AS, YA. Note that for two sites (LF and HS), the median values of daytime $\Delta T$ are negative.

Comparison of estimated plot-scale LST using $\epsilon_{MODIS}$ at satellite overpass time with landscape scale LST ($T_{MODIS}$) revealed strong correlations between plot-scale and landscape scale LST estimates as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:LST local and MODIS}a, b. Use  of plot-scale $\epsilon_{plot}$ for LST estimation ($T_{seq}$ and $T_{leq}$) resulted in substantial reduction of the bias as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:LST local and MODIS}c, d. This trend in bias reduction was similar to other sites (Table \textbf{SI2} for details). The  minimum bias is found  at the TUM, a closed canopy (eucalyptforest) and highest bias was obtained at LF, HS, heterogeneous ecosystems with sparse canopies (woodland savanna). However, for some sites, weak correlation between satellite-derived and local LST estimates were also evident (at DU, $R^2$ was reduced from 0.8 to 0.4, see Table \textbf{SI2}). Also, using plot-scale $\epsilon$ for LST estimation resulted in positive $T_{s} - T_{a}$ at LF and HS as shown in \textbf{SI3, Fig. \ref{fig:hs_hdt}} in comparison to Fig. \ref{fig:long_short_eq_epsilon_MODIS}.

\subsection{Plot-scale $\epsilon$ estimation considering footprint mismatch}
In order to account for the discrepancy due to footprint mismatch of measuring devices or systematic bias in measured fluxes the $H$ ($\Delta T$) linear fit was allowed to accept an intercept (instead of forcing it to zero as in Fig. \ref{fig:HDT}) for plot-scale $\epsilon$ estimation. As shown in Fig. \ref{fig:2_mx_c} title, the plot-scale $\epsilon$ using linear regression with an intercept results into the conventional (realistic) range of emissivity which is in contrast to the estimates without intercept as shown in Table (\ref{table:eps_comp}). The intercept value for BR, a grassland, is 12\% of maximum sensible heat flux ($H_{max}$) and for a mulga shrubland like AS is 20\% of $H_{max}$ (Fig. \ref{fig:2_mx_c}). The intercept value for HS is very high (70\% of $H_{max}$) and for TUM is 7\% of $H_{max}$. The intercept value is lowest for a homogenous land cover like TUM and highest for heterogeneous canopy like HS, LF. The comparison of resulting plot-scale LST with landscape scale LST shows an increase in bias with respect to the LST obtained using $\epsilon$ without an intercept as shown in Table (\ref{table:eps_comp}). 
%The $\epsilon$ value estimated using simplified equation with allowing an intercept in resulted in substantial reduction in $\epsilon$ (lower by 12.7$\%$)

\subsection{Uncertainty in plot-scale $\epsilon$ and LST}
Each of the observed input variables used for the estimation of plot-scale $\epsilon$ and LST has a certain level of measurement uncertainty associated with it. Here we present an exemplary results for Alice Springs, which showed the highest correlation between plot-scale and landscape scale LST estimations (Table \textbf{SI2}). 
%The box plot shows range of values such that any repetition of the flux measurement within the error bounds of input parameters will produce a new result, which will be within the interval shown by the boxplot. 
The uncertainty in plot-scale $\epsilon$ estimated using Eq. (\ref{eq_Tleq})  without allowing an intercept for $H(\Delta  T)$ ranged between 0.68 and 0.98. The short equation (Eq.\ref{eq_Tseq}) resulted in constrained values between 0.94 and 0.99 shown by the black boxes (Fig. \ref{fig:eps_unc1}a). The uncertainty in $\epsilon$ is propagated to obtain hourly uncertainty in $T_{s} - T_{a}$ using Eq. (\ref{eq_Tleq}) and Eq. (\ref{eq_Tseq} as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:eps_unc1}b, c. The uncertainty range for plot-scale LST was quite similar for both long and short equation (blue and black boxes in Fig. \ref{fig:eps_unc1}b, c). The uncertainty in $T_{s} - T_{a}$ increased when landscape-scale $\epsilon$ was used as shown by the orange boxes in Fig. \ref{fig:eps_unc1}b, c.
%is shown using in Fig. (\ref{fig:eps_unc1}b) and Fig. (\ref{fig:eps_unc1}c). $T_{s}$ estimated using Eq. (\ref{eq_Tleq}) and Eq. (\ref{eq_tseq}) is shown in blue and black. The uncertainty range of hourly $\Delta$ T is high using fluxes error bounds with constant $\epsilon$ (MODIS based) shown as orange boxes. The range of $T_{s} - T_{a}$ uncertainty is alomst similar for Eq. (\ref{eq_leq}) and Eq. (\ref{eq_seq}) shown by blue and black boxes respectively. However, the range of $T_{s}$ estimated using Eq. (\ref{eq_leq}) is higher due to the lower value of optimised emissivity (Eq. (\ref{eq_Tleq})). The use of MODIS based constant $\epsilon$ leads to greater bias in hourly estimate of $\Delta$T

\section{Discussion}
%%SJS: The below is jumping a bit back and forth between topics. Following the discussion of spatial heterogeneity of epsilon, you should now also mention the spatial heterogeneity of LST and explain what the remotely-sensed aggregated values mean in this context. Then explain and discuss our findings from this perspective, i.e. comparison between TMODIS, Tseq and Tleq, the low epsilon values and uncertainty. You could then go back to H(DT), discuss the negative DT at H=0 and a potential intercept and its effect on epsilon. You can refer to the SI for supporting your explanations. If your analysis with intercept is part of the main paper, you need to introduce the associated research question in the intro and the plots in the results. You cannot introduce new figures in the discussion. Does Scientific Reports actually  a conclusions section?

Our analysis revealed the deficiency in commonly used short equation for estimating plot-scale LST and $\epsilon$. The use of long equation for plot-scale $\epsilon$ estimation result intoto lower values for canopy with heterogeneous land cover. In order to obtain realistic $\epsilon$ for sparse canopy with heterogeneous landcover, acknowledging footprint mismatch between radiometric and aerodynamic measurements becomes important.

Depending on the equation (Eq. \ref{eq_Tleq} or Eq. \ref{eq_Tseq}) used to estimate LST, small approximation (error) in $\epsilon$ can lead to a large error in LST. The sensitivity of the long equation (Eq. \ref{eq_Tleq}) to $\epsilon$ is driven by the contrast between $R_{lup}$ and $R_{ldwn}$ whereas, for short equation (Eq. \ref{eq_Tseq}), it is only driven by observed $R_{lup}$ (\textbf{SI Fig. \ref{fig:longwave}}). For instance, an error of 0.01 in $\epsilon$ at water limited sites like AS can cause an error of 0.17$K$ using Eq. (\ref{eq_Tleq}) and 0.79$K$ using Eq. (\ref{eq_Tseq}) respectively (\textbf{SI Fig. \ref{fig:LST sensitivity to emissivity}}). This shows a clear advantage of using Eq. (\ref{eq_Tleq}) for plot-scale LST estimation, since, plot-scale $\epsilon$ is unknown and therefore used as an approximate value \cite{mallick2018bridging}. Also, plot-scale $\epsilon$ estimation using long equation (Eq. \ref{eq_Tleq}) results into $H(\Delta T)$ relationship for more months ($R^{2} > 0.5$, blue stars in Fig. \ref{fig:HDT}d). However, $\epsilon$ estimates using Eq. (\ref{eq_Tleq}) are lower than Eq. (\ref{eq_Tseq}) and in particular for sites like HS and LF, the $\epsilon$ was unrealistic (\textbf{SI} Table \ref{table:SI2_optlstandmod}) in comparison to the previously reported  $\epsilon$ values for a soil-vegetation system\cite{sugita_optimal_1996-1,snyder1998classification}. 

The lower $\epsilon$ value using long equation for sparse canopy (Table \ref{table:eps_comp}) suggests bias due to combining measurements coming from instruments (radiometer, eddy covariance system) characterized by different footprints\cite{marcolla2018geometry}. The mismatch of  source areas becomes important if the surface underlying the instruments  have heterogeneous land cover (e.g. AS,TT, YA, AS, HS, LF). However, "footprint awareness" is  often omitted at ECS under the assumption of ho­mogeneity \cite{chu2021representativeness}. The mismatch in footprint can result in unrepresentativeness of targeted ecosystem which may further lead to $H\not= 0$ at $\Delta T=0$. This problem was not detected for Holmes et al. \cite{holmes_land_2009-1}, as short equation (Eq. \ref{eq_Tseq}) was used, and due to its high sensitivity to $\epsilon$ (\textbf{SI Fig. \ref{fig:LST sensitivity to emissivity}} a) even  with small reduction in $\epsilon$ the offset in $H(\Delta T)$ was corrected (Fig. \ref{fig:HDT}a). Whereas, due to lower sensitivity of Eq. (\ref{eq_Tleq}( to $\epsilon$ (\textbf{SI Fig. \ref{fig:LST sensitivity to emissivity}} a), a larger reduction is required to remove the intercept resulting into lower $\epsilon$ as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:HDT}b. We proposed an improvement to the method by allowing an intercept in $H(\Delta T)$ regression (robust regression). Considering aerodynamic footprint to be larger than radiometric footprint \cite{marcolla2018geometry,chu2021representativeness}, the offset was interpreted as the $H$ from aerodynamic footprint which is not seen by the radiometer and resulted into realistic $\epsilon$ (Fig {\ref{fig:2_mx_c}a, b, c, d). The intercept was very high for sites like HS and LF (Table. \ref{table:eps_comp}). Placing high value of intercept into perspective for HS and LF, we looked closely at $H(\Delta T)$ plots for HS and LF (\textbf{SI} Fig. \ref{fig:hs_hdt}) and negative daytime $T_{s} -T_{a}$ (Fig. \ref{fig:long_short_eq_epsilon_MODIS}) we could hypothesize an underestimation of $R_{lup}$. Testing the hypothesis for HS we found that  adding roughly 40 $Wm^-{2}$ (approx 8\% of observed $R_{lup}$, Fig. \ref{fig:wninb}) in observed $R_{lup}$ led to significant reduction in the intercept from 294 $Wm^-{2}$ (Fig. \ref{fig:2_mx_c} c) to 17 $Wm^-{2}$ with positive $T_{s} - T_{a}$ as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:mxc_dis}a. The other linear regression parameter m, $R^{2}$, RMSE remain constant for Fig. \ref{fig:mxc_dis}a and Fig. \ref{fig:2_mx_c}c. The hemispherical view of the radiometers looking down at the heterogeneous canopy, makes it possible to have more tree crowns and less soil for HS and LF. This can lead to an underestimation of $R_{lup}$, approximately by 5-10$\%$ (\textbf{SI 6}, Fig. \ref{fig:wninb}). As shown in Fig. \ref{fig:2_mx_c}, the offset in $H(\Delta T)$ was proportional to the maximum observed $H$ for each month (\textbf{SI 7} Fig. \ref{fig:yr_intrc}). The ratio between $H_{max}$ and intercept varies between $0\%$ to $30 \%$ for AS. The monthly seasonality in intercept and dominant wind direction was not significant.
% Limitation:surface energy balance closure.
%\cite{marcolla2018geometry,rotenberg2011distinct}
Surface heterogeneity has also been recognized as one of the potential causes for the lack of energy balance closure observed at most ECS \cite{wilson2002energy, stoy2013data} at diurnal scales. Therefore, as a prerequisite the observed turbulent fluxes are corrected using an energy balance closure scheme \cite{foken2008energy} before use. However, in our analysis the use of energy balance closure scheme (based on Bowen ratio) led to much lower value of plot-scale $\epsilon$ using Holmes approach. Other studies on plot-scale $\epsilon$ estimation have also used the observed fluxes without correction\cite{chen2003surface, holmes_land_2009-1,juang2007separating,maes2019potential}. The use of energy balance closure scheme for plot-scale $\epsilon$ estimation led to an increase in positive intercept (sparse canopy, Fig. \ref{fig:2_mx_c}). We also looked into the intercept of $H(\Delta T)$ by closing energy imbalance using Bowen ratio closure scheme which result into higher intercept as shown in Fig \ref{fig:mxc_dis}b. These results show that the relation between intercept in $H(\Delta T)$ and lack of energy balance closure is not  conclusive.

Comparison of plot-scale LST with MODIS LST resulted into very high bias for sparse canopy which is in agreement with previous studies where the bias for sparse canopy reached upto 12$K$ \cite{guillevic2018land}. Plot-scale LST estimates using plot-scale $\epsilon$ reduced the bias in comparson to MODIS LST as shown in Table \textbf{\ref{table:SI2_optlstandmod}}. The use of plot-scale $\epsilon$ also reduces the uncertainty in diurnal LST in comparson to  landscape scale $\epsilon$ (Fig. \ref{fig:eps_unc1}b,c). However, LST estimated using plot-scale $\epsilon$ considering  foot print mismatch ($H=m*\Delta T +c$) resulted into increase in bias for most of the study sites as shown in Table \ref{table:eps_comp}. The increase in bias could be attributed to implicit consideration of spatial heterogeneity (by accepting intercept) at plot-scale, whereas, MODIS LST (landscape scale) are integrated pixel information considering radiating signal from a homogeneous surface.

The fluxes observed at a soil-vegetation system is representative of the composite signal from both, soil and vegetation which typically have a different range of surface temperatures and emissivities\cite{jin_improved_2006-1}. The $\epsilon$ of soil strongly depends on soil moisture content \cite{mira2007influence}, whereas, the $\epsilon$ of a canopy depends on its structural attributes and leaf area index, the latter of which varies strongly at the seasonal scale \cite{chen2015determining}. For example, the laboratory-measured directional $\epsilon$ for various canopy elements (bark, leaf and its arrangement, stem wood) ranged between 0.9 to 1 \cite{vishnevetsky2019method}. %SJS: Could you cite the paper by Dan Yakir's group here? , %GT:yes, done
Laboratory measurements of thermal infrared reflectance spectra suggests that the $\epsilon$ variation from structural unknowns, such as leaf orientation, is more significant than the differences in leaf component emissivity among plant species \cite{snyder1998classification}. Consequently, it is clear that the $\epsilon$ of a surface is a function of many factors and detailed study of all these factors is out of scope of the present study. Thus, derivation of landscape-scale broadband $\epsilon_{land}$ from narrowband spectral emissivity is considered as a first-order approximation for capturing the integrated effects of land cover from MODIS spectral bands\cite{jin_improved_2006-1}. However, due to general lack of emissivity information for natural ecosystem at ECS, satellite derived emissivity serves as plausible estimates and are valuable input for plot-scale LST estimation. Plot-scale $\epsilon$ by fitting observed $H$ and estimated $\Delta T$ without an intercept results into a lower value and is statistically questionable \cite{eisenhauer2003regression}. Since fluxes observed at ECS contain composite (soil and vegetation) signal aggregated over space and time, allowing an intercept for $H(\Delta T$) makes the linearfit statistically correct, and, results into realistic $\epsilon$ range. Estimation of an intrinsic property like $\epsilon$ using time varying fluxes can be considered imprecise; however, considering the spatial and temporal limitation of satellite derived data, the plot-scale $\epsilon$ estimation is a good alternative.

Our results show that under no condition for grey bodies, the use of short equation and long equation can lead to equal values of $\epsilon$ and LST and thus, the use of Eq. (\ref{eq_Tseq}) is not recommended. Considering the widely spread use of both ECS recorded fluxes and MODIS LST in LSMs applications, the use of plot-scale $\epsilon$ can be advantageous as it reduces the bias between plot-scale and MODIS LST. Plot-scale $\epsilon$ also lowers the uncertainty in diurnal LST due to measurement uncertainty in comparison to the MODIS based emissivity. Therefore, the approach proposed in this work has the potential to provide a more robust benchmark information for model calibration and validation. Realistic estimate of plot-scale $\epsilon$ by allowing an intercept in the linearfit of $H (\Delta T)$ emphasises on integration of "footprint awareness" concept for using eddy covariance fluxes. Overall, the implications of our study are of particular relevance for the research community interested in understanding diurnal and seasonal feedback in soil-vegetation systems based on fluxes, emissivity and LST estimated at a consistent scale.

%\item Is the short equation (Eq. \ref{eq_Tseq}), neglecting the reflected down-welling longwave radiation, adequate to estimate LST from ground-based measurements?
%\item Does accepting an intercept in $H (\Delta$ T) lead to realistic estimate of plot-scale $\epsilon$?

\section{Methods}  \label{sec:Methods}
\subsubsection{Research data}
\textbf{Tower data}:
ECS collect micro-meteorological measurements above the surface (vegetation canopy) using towers (flux tower) following common measurement protocols \cite{baldocchi2001fluxnet}. The towers are commonly equipped with an instrument made up of pyrgeometers or radiometers to measure up-welling and down-welling shortwave and longwave radiation, which is further used to calculate net radiation (Eq. \ref{eq_Rn1}). Besides radiative fluxes, measurement at ECS also include sensible and latent heat fluxes, net carbon-dioxide exchange and a range of meteorological variables, such as air temperature, humidity and wind speed. $T_{a}$ is the air temperature measured at a reference height above the canopy. Each flux measurement is accompanied by a flagging system and follows the agreement with second CarboEurope-IP QA/QC workshop \cite{gilberto2020fluxnet2015}. Flag 0 is designated as high data quality, and have been used in our current work. For the analysis, ten sites were selected to represent a variety of land cover types and climates (Table \ref{table:studysites}). Eight sites belong to the North Australian Tropical Transect (NATT) and 2 sites (Yatir Forest, Brookings) are chosen to replicate results from Holmes et.al\cite{holmes_land_2009-1}. Eddy covariance Level 3 data is obtained from http://data.ozflux.org.au/portal/pub/listPubCollections.jspx for Australian sites. The data for Brookings was obtained from ameriflux and for Yatir Forest, the data was obtained using personal communication to Prof Dan Yakir's lab group as the data used in Holmes work was from 2005 \cite{holmes_land_2009} and the current available data was an updated version of the fluxnet data.%(http://www.ntlis.nt.gov.au/metadata/export_data?metadata_id=2DBCB77120B306B6E040CD9B0F274EFE&type=html#Citation).a. %SJS: Yatir Forest is not really 

\textbf{MODIS data}:
%SJS: In the methods section, you don't need to explain why you did certain things, just what and how.
%Plot scale retreived temperature is compared to MODIS daily LST data and  MODIS daily spectral emissivity are used to estimate emissivity in general approach for LST retreival. 
Landscape scale emissivity and LST data (MODIS product MOD11A1) was downloaded from NASA earth data \href{https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/}. It is a level 3 daily LST product gridded in the sinusoidal projection at a spatial resolution of 0.928 $km$ by 0.928 $km$. A tile contains 1200 x 1200 grids in 1200 rows and 1200 columns\cite{wan2007collection}. The daily LST pixel values in each granules is retrieved by the generalized split-window algorithm under clear-sky conditions and LST values are averaged by overlapping pixels in each grid with overlapping areas as weight. The downloaded data in hierarchical data format (hdf), were converted into tagged image file format (tiff) using a python package called PyModis \cite{delucchi2014pymodis}. From tiff the files are converted into csv format. The details of data extraction and conversion can be found at $https://renkulab.io/projects/gitanjali.thakur/modis_lst_fpar/$. The dataset columns used to compare plot-scale LST and emissivity are: day time daily LST, local view time, night view time, channel 31, 32  spectral $\epsilon$ respectively. 
 %The daily LST pixel values in each granules is retrieved by the generalized split-window algorithm under clear-sky conditions through mapping all the valid clear-sky LST values onto grids in the sinusoidal projection and averaging the LST values of overlapping pixels in each grid with overlapping areas as weight..

\textbf{Site specific approach}:
%The above expression for sensible heat (Eq. \ref{eq_H}) is based on two assumptions: (1) $H$ is directly proportional to the near-surface temperature gradient; and (2) the temperature gradient is represented by a difference in radiometric surface temperature and air temperature ($T_{s} - T_{a}$).
%Range of emissivity is selected starting from the maximum possible emissivity of grey body (0.998) and with each iteration and emissivity is reduced in a step size of 0.002 untill $T_{s} - T_{a}$ is 0 at $H = 0$. The emissivity at which the regression between $H(\Delta$ T) passed through zero and the root mean square error is minimum ( see methods for detail) is called as optimum emissivity. 
This approach was initially proposed by Holmes\cite{holmes_land_2009-1} to estimate plot-scale $\epsilon$ using short equation with $H$, $R_{lup}$, $T_{a}$. In the present work, we have used both long equation (Eq. \ref{eq_Tleq}) and short equation (Eq. \ref{eq_Tseq}) to estimate $\epsilon$.
The prime variable used in the study are $H$, $R_{lup}$, $R_{ldwn}$, and, $T_{a}$ while the ancillary variables $R_{n}$ and wind speed ($Ws$) are used to filter the data for analysis. The filtering condition were ($R_{n} > 25 Wm^-2$) and wind speed ($Ws > 2ms^-1$)\cite{holmes_land_2009}. Plot-scale emissivity is derived by segregating each month data satisfying the filtering criteria. For estimating $T_{s}$ from longwave measurement ($R_{lup}$, $R_{ldwn}$), a predefined range of $\epsilon$ is chosen starting from 0.998 and is reduced with a step-size of 0.002 upto 0.4. For each month data, $H (T_{s} - T_{a})$ linear regression is performed using scipy $https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.14.0/reference/generated/scipy.stats.linregress.html$. The
$R^2$ is checked and months where $R^{2} > 0.5$ (i.e. substantial part of variance in H is explained by $T_{s} -T_{a}$) is chosen for $\epsilon$ estimation. To obtain $\epsilon$, the regression line of $H (\Delta T)$ is forced through origin (at $T_{s} - T_{a} = 0 $  $H=0$) by minimising the RMSE. An illustration plot for RMSE and $\epsilon$ is shown in \textbf{SI5}. The $\epsilon$ is obtained for each month using both, long Eq.(\ref{eq_Tleq}) and short equation Eq.(\ref{eq_Tseq}) and termed as $\epsilon_{leq}$ and $\epsilon_{seq}$ respectively, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:flow_chart}b. In order to account for the role of spatial heterogeneity in the observed
fluxes at a tower site, $H(\Delta T)$ linear fit is allowed to have an offset. The plot-scale $\epsilon$ was obtained by minimising RMSE as explained before (an example for one month at AS in Fig. \ref{fig:rmse_eps}). Plot-scale LST estimated using plot-scale $\epsilon$ (with and without intercept in $H(\Delta T)$ linear fit was compared to landscape scale MODIS LST. Monthly tower-based longwave measurement at study sites corresponding to TERRA daily time of pass was obtained using linear interpolation. TERRA (satellite) overpasses at local solar time between 10:30 am to 12 pm in ascending mode \cite{guillevic2017land}. Plot-scale LST at local satellite overpass ( $T_{leq}$ and $T_{seq}$) was obtained using interpolated longwave radiation measurement and coressponding monthly plot-scale $\epsilon$. Plot-scale daily LST is compared to MODIS LST in terms of mean, bias, RMSE and $R^2$ using a robust linear regression model (scipy stat model) as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:flow_chart}a. The goodness of fit between plot-scale and landscape scale LST was determined by looking at $R^2$ as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:flow_chart}b. The bias is estimated as mean of deviation between daily MODIS LST and ground based $T_{s}$ ($T_{leq,seq} - T_{MODIS}$). See SI table for data sources and acronyms in \textbf{SI1}.

The other approach for plot-scale $\epsilon$ estimation using Eq. (\ref{eq_Rlup}) is discussed by Maes et.al (2019)\cite{maes2019potential}. For each month, the observed $R_{lup}$,  $R_{ldwn}$, $T_{a}$  are filtered for non rainy days, $-2 < H <2$ , and $\alpha < 0.4$. The $\epsilon$ is estimated by substituting $T_{s} = T_{a}$ in Eq. (\ref{eq_Rlup}) as shown in Eq. (\ref{eq_e_Maes}). The monthly $\epsilon$  was represented as the median of $\epsilon$ obtained by substituting filtered data in Eq. (\ref{eq_e_Maes}). 
\begin{equation}\label{eq_e_Maes}
\epsilon = \frac{R_{ldwn} - R_{lup}}{R_{ldwn} - T_{a}^{4} \sigma}
\end{equation}

\textbf{General approach}:
The radiative energy emitted at a specific wavelength is related to its temperature using Planck's function\cite{wang_estimation_2005-1}. Thermal remote sensing (MODIS) is used to measure spectral emissivity through four channels (28, 29, 30, 31) at wavelengths ranging between 8-12 $\mu$m \cite{jin_improved_2006-1} and the system of equations is iteratively solved for a given range of wavelengths (9 - 12$\mu$m) to obtain $\epsilon$ and LST using radiative transfer models\cite{hulley_quantifying_2012-1,jin2006improved,wang_evaluation_2009}. We estimate landscape scale broadband $\epsilon$ using MODIS spectral $\epsilon$ as shown in Bahir et. al (2017)\cite{bahir_evaluation_2017}.
\begin{equation}\label{eq_emodis}
\epsilon_{MODIS}= 0.4587 \epsilon_{31} + 0.5414 \epsilon_{32}
\end{equation}
Tower based longwave radiation measurement ($R_{lup}$, $R_{ldwn}$) passing the filtering criteria (as mentioned in site specific approach) along with MODIS based $\epsilon$ was used to invert LST using Eq. (\ref{eq_Tleq}) and  Eq. (\ref{eq_Tseq}). The obtained plot-scale LST was compared to landscape scale MODIS LST using a robust linear regression as mentioned in site specific approach as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:flow_chart}a.

%In order to avoid the  error in  measured longwave fluxes, quality flag filter has been applied to the datasets used for LST retreivals. The remaining speculated source of error can be MODIS based surface emissivity, therefore another method of broadband emissivity estimation is used

\textbf{Uncertainty estimation}:
The turbulent fluxes of $H$ measured at the ECS are averaged over smaller time (30 or 60 minutes) and the averaging over this time interval is typically dominated by random errors \cite{rannik2016random, mauder2020surface}. The other source of error is the radiation measurement which can vary between sites due to the difference in accuracy and precision of the in-situ radiometers or pyrgeometer, differences in field of view (fov), wavelength bands, and spectral response functions of the sensors. For reference, the accuracy of dedicated infrared temperature (IRT) sensors is given by their manufacturers as $0.5$K, but it is not clear what sources of uncertainty are considered in this estimation \cite{vickers2010uncertainty}. Thus, we estimated the uncertainty in plot-scale $\epsilon$ due to uncertainty is observed fluxes. In first step, the error bounds of each input variables ($ H$, $R_{lup}$, $R_{ldw}$, $T_{a}$) used in plot-scale $\epsilon$ is defined. The error bounds for $R_{lup}$ and $R_{ldwn}$ are -5 to 5 W m$^{-2}$ \cite{trenberth2012tracking}, for $H$, it is -20 to 20 W m$^{-2}$ and for $T_{a}$, it is -1 to 1 K \cite{foken2008energy}. Uniformly distributed error samples within bounds are generated using saltelli sampling scheme\cite{saltelli2017new} using python based package name SALIB. Each error samples are added to the monthly segregated measured fluxes as explained in site specific approach. The $H(\Delta T)$ linear fit for the fluxes with added uncertainty (error sample) is obtained and plot-scale $\epsilon$ is estimated by minimising RMSE as explained in site specific approach. The range of plot-scale $\epsilon$ is reported as uncertainity in $\epsilon$. The plot-scale $\epsilon$ uncertainty is propogated to obtain uncertainty in hourly LST using short equation Eq. (\ref{eq_Tseq}) and long equation Eq. (\ref{eq_Tleq}) as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:eps_unc1}b, c.

In general, the broadband emissivity range for a land cover can vary between 0.87 to 0.98\cite{jin_improved_2006}. The noontime measured longwave for two contrasting landcover types (semi-arid mulga, tropical savanna woodland) are used to quantify the sensitivity of LST to emissivity as shown in Fig. (\ref{fig:LST sensitivity to emissivity}).
