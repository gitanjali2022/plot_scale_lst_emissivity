LEVEL 3 – VARIABLES DECRIPTION



Level 3 data are obtained from the level 2 products, data are quality 
checked using standardized techniques and NEE is calculated. Data are 
not changed but descriptive variables (‘flags’) are added.


- Month: from 1 to 12
- Day: day of the month
- Hour: from 0 to 23.5, indicates the end of the half hour of 
measurement 
- DoY: decimal day of the year
- CO2: carbon dioxide concentration measured at top of the tower 
[umol/mol]
- H2O: water vapour concentration measured at top of the tower 
[mmol/mol]
- ZL: atmosphere stability parameter
- Fc: carbon dioxide flux  [umolCO2 m-2 s-1]
- qf_Fc: fluxes quality flags (see below)
- NEE_st: Net Ecosystem Exchange standardized -  calculated using the 
storage obtained with the discrete approach (single point on the top of 
the tower) with the same method for all the sites [umolCO2 m-2 s-1]
- qf_NEE_st: fluxes quality flags (see below)
- NEE_or: Net Ecosystem Exchange original -  calculated using the 
storage sent by the PI that can be obtained with the discrete approach or 
using the profile system (see others information below) [umolCO2 m-2 s-1]
- qf_NEE_or: fluxes quality flags (see below)
- H: sensible heat flux [W m-2]
- LE: latent heat flux [W m-2]
- Ustar: friction velocity  [m s-1]
- qf_ust: quality flag: 0 = ok, 1 = possible spike. Calculated starting 
from the linear regration between ustar and wind speed. Flagged as 1 if 
the residual are bigger than 5 times the standard deviation.
- Precip: precipitation [mm]
- Rg: global radiation [W m-2]
- PPFD: photosynthetic photon flux density [umol m-2 s-1]
- R_pot: potential radiation (‘at top of atmosphere’) calculated from 
time and geographic coordinates [W m-2]
- qf_Rg: quality flag for Rg: 0=ok, 1=possible bad values. Calculated 
comparing measured Rg and potential radiation.
- qf_Rad: quality flag for Rg and PPFD: 0 = ok, 1 = possible bad 
values. Calculated starting from the linear regration between the two 
variables. Flagged as 1 if the residual are bigger than 5 times the standard 
deviation.
- Rr: reflected radiation [W m-2]
- Rn: net radiation [W m-2]
- Rd: diffuse radiation (global) [W m-2]
- APAR: light interception [umol m-2 s-1]
- Ta: air temperature [°C]
- Ts1: soil temperature depth 1 [°C]
- Ts2: soil temperature depth 2 [°C]
- SWC1: soil water content depth 1 [%vol]
- SWC2: soil water content depth 2 [%vol]
- G1: soil heat flux  [W m-2]
- G2: soil heat flux  [W m-2]
- Rh: relative humidity  [%]
- WD: wind direction [degrees]
- WS: wind horizontal speed [m s-1]


Flux quality flags explanation:
The qc_flag is a 9 bits number. See below the explanation:

Bit 9: QC from PI
0 = ok (class 0-1 of QA/QC method based on raw data – Foken et al.)
1 = not ok (class 2)

Bit 8: Marginal point  (at the border to a gap)
0 = no
1 = marginal point

Bits 7-6: ustar criterion
00 = ok
01 = below threshold
10 = preceding values is below threshold
11 = below threshold and preceding below threshold

Bits 5-4: Spike detection
00 = no spike
01 = spike as outside 4 SD
10 = spike as outside 5.5 SD
11 = spike as outside 7 SD or out of range.

Bit 3: Low variability
0 = ok
1 = low variability (e.g. when pump is broken etc.)

Bits 2-1: Summary
00 = best
01 = medium (not used)
10 = bad
11 = missing
