Versioning code
We use a versioning code to identify univocally the version of each dataset. 
Data improvement, new submission, reprocessing, added variables etc. will automatically involve a new code definition with different version number and the description of the differences with the previous datasets.

Please note that the qc flags associated with NEE filled using ANN are not exhaustive because the quality depends also by other aspects like the availability of data in the same period of the year and of the day that can be used for the training process.
