# plot_scale LST 

This project contains variable definitions, equations and  from the paper titled: Challenges and uncertainty in estimating emissivity and surface temperature using flux tower measurements.

At the plot-scale, the flux tower recorded up-welling and, down-welling longwave radiation components are inverted (we named it long equation) to retrieve land surface temperature (LST). Since the down-welling longwave component was not measured routinely until recently, usually only the up-welling longwave component is used (we named it short equation) for the plot-scale LST retrieval and emissivity estimation. Plot-scale emissivity was estimated using a fitting procedure based on observed sensible heat flux and estimated surface-to-air temperature difference. Even with the availability of down-welling longwave radiation it is a common practice to use short equation for LST and emissivity estimation. In this project we have used 10 eddy-covariance data to answer three relevant questions:

1. How much bias is introduced in plot-scale LST and emissivity when short equation is used instead of long equation?
2.Does plot-scale emissivity estimation have an advantage over landscape-scale (MODIS) emissivity?
3.How much uncertainty is introduced in plot-scale LST and Îµ due to uncertainty in measured EC fluxes?
